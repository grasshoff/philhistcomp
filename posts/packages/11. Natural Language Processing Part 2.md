To learn everything you need to know about spaCy, take a look at the documentation:

https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101



Do not forget to check the Notebook of this tutorial to see the examples.



## Dependency parse

A very cool feature is displaCy, to visualize a dependency parse or named entities in a sentence. 

```
from spacy import displacy
```

To visualize a dependency parse:

```
displacy.render(doc, style='dep', jupyter=True)
```

To visualize named entities:

```
displacy.render(doc, style='ent', jupyter=True)
```

Remember that you have to define 'doc' before.

Here you can see the documentation of displaCy:
