# Regular Expressions

Imagine you have to search a string like 'world' in the first proposition of Wittgenstein's _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_. You can use the keyword 'in' as follows:

```
'world' in 'The world is all that is the case.'
```

If we run the cell, we will get 'true' or 'false' depending on whether the string is there.



Now imagine that you do not want a specific string, but to search for a pattern, like all the numbers that have format #.##, then you need a regular expression. Each character type has a pattern code. For example, digits have the pattern code \d (for any number). Thus the regular expression would be r'\d.\d{2}'.

First, we have to import re:

```
import re
```

Next, we define a text and a pattern. To get the first match, we use the re.search() function:

```
re.search(pattern, text)
```

To get all the matches, we use the re.findall() function. The 'r' before the pattern stands for 'regular expression.'

```
re.findall(r'\d.\d{2}', text)
```

To see how many patterns did Python find, use the len() function. Please check the Jupyter notebook for all the details.
