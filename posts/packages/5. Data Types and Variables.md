# Variable Assigments

You can find out the type of a variable using the following built-in function:

```
type(x)
```

- We can assign the data types to a variable name.

- - Take into account that names can not start with a number; there can be no spaces or symbols (but you can use underscore).
  - Typically, we use lowercase letters for variable names.
  - Avoid names that have a special meaning in Python, for example, 'str' or 'int.' These words will have a syntax highlighting, that is a different color that will alert you. 

- In Python, it is possible to reassign a variable name to a different data type (in other languages, it would produce an error).

  ```
  soul = 3
  soul = ['vegetative', 'sensitive', 'rational']bb
  ```
