# MkDocs

## Installation

To use the mkdocs web browser, install the following: 

```
pip install mkdocs
```

We need to install some extensions to see the formated jupyter notebooks.

```
pip install mkdocs-jupyter
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin
pip install pygments
pip install pymdown-extensions
```

```
pip install nbconvert

# OR

conda install nbconvert
```

```
conda install setuptools
conda install setuptools_scm
conda install pylint
conda install flake8
conda install black
conda install isort
conda install twine
conda install wheel
conda install pytest
conda install pytest-cov
```



## Command

When everything is installed, you can change the working directory to the folder "documentary." In my case is:

```
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\philhistcomp\documentation
```

Then use the command:

```
mkdocs serve
```

The last step is to open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or whatever page that appears in the terminal. You are going to see every change that you save in your files at the same time.
