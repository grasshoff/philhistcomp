**Background**

Political debate is always conducted within given infrastructures, which will necessarily shape the nature of the debate. The later years have shown how online political debate – that is, political debate in a virtual space – increasingly generate expressions of extreme opinions. Examples are racist, sexist, and hateful comments. The rise of such expressions can partly be explained by the fact that online anonymity reduces the fear of social exclusion. That is, one can express extremity and hatred without fearing the condemnation of one’s analogue circumstances. 

This project is motivated by the hypothesis that there is another core factor, namely, the physical absence of the other. It is plausible that the physical absence of one’s interlocutor diminishes one’s engagement with the interlocutor as a person. Furthermore, it is likely that a reduced engagement with the other as a person reduces the ability and will to empathize with her/him. The word “you” functions as a sign of some kind of engagement with the other (in singular or plural), which on my interpretation is a trace of empathy. Words like “we” and “they”, however, are more often used to express othering-constructions (“we” against “them”). My project aim is to find out how often the word “you” is used in extreme online discussions, compared to the words “we” and “they”. The sentiment analysis will be conducted on the example of the discussion thread “Politically Incorrect” (/pol/) on the online image board 4chan.org. 


**Research objects**

Research objects = text file: all the text from the thread /pol/ on 4chan.org from June 2016 – November 2019. 

Empirical sources = 

Alternative 1: Dataset from Papasavva et.al: a dataset with over 3.3M threads and 134.5M posts from the Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) of the imageboard forum 4chan, posted over a period of almost 3.5 years (June 2016–November 2019). 
Dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/3606810#.XrGNxKgzY2x


Alternative 2: Extract data from https://archive.4plebs.org/ (all threads from 2013 till today) and process it with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

**Research question** = engagement with the discussion partner in virtual debate: how often does the word “you” appear in comparison with the words “we”, “they” and “I” in the thread /pol/ on the image board 4chan.org?
