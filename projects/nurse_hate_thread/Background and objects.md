### Background

Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic nurses (alongside doctors and other medical workers) have been celebrated around the word for risking their health and working overtime in order to fight the virus. The work done by nurses has been subject to increased attention, which has among other led to a debate on their work conditions and wages. 

The global mainstream celebration of nurses has, however, also provoked hatred and frustration, mainly among men. On the male dominated online imageboard 4chan.org there has been a rise of discussion threads revolving around hatred against nurses. These threads mostly appear on the board /pol/ ("Politically Incorrect"). Such threads are often referred to as "nurse hate" threads. The vast majority of these discussions combine the hatred against nurses with explicit misogyny; the nurses are mostly incapable, immoral or immature in virtue of being women. 

I will investigate how female nurses are described in online debate on 4chan, and if the expressed hatred against female nurses functions as a vent for misogyny. Once I have systematized these descriptions, I want to sketch out how the pandemic influences the online (4chan) construction of the female other, on the example of nurses. Do new misogynist characteristics emerge as a consequence of the pandemic?

**Research question**

How is the female other constructed in "nurse hate threads" on /pol/ (4chan.org), during the pandemic? 

**Research object**

Posts about nurses during the pandemic from the board /pol/ on 4chan.org. The posts date from the 25th of January 2020 till 18th of July 2020. This amounts to 108 posts (some might be irrelevant). 

**Empirical source**

A textfile generated by a script that scrapes the text from the 108 posts. 

The content is scraped from the archive (1) for 4chan.org: https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/subject/nurse/start/2020-01-25, using jupyter notebook (2).

*(1) One concern is that I extract the content from an archive (4plebs) and not from the page itself. The problem with the original page, however, is that there is so much content generated on 4chan everyday that the posts are normally automatically deleted on the very day they are published. Whereas the archive has saved all posts since April 2013 (see more on "Infos 4plebs").*
