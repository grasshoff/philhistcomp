It is particularly damaging during the coronavirus, when trust is most needed in healthcare professionals. \\n\\nWhat I am hearing and seeing apalls me. These are younger nurses, all in their early 20s. You would not see such behavior with older, seasoned nurses. \\n\\nWomen have been sold a lie – a poison masked as an antidote – and now they are beginning to show the symptoms. Having been promised liberation from domineering husbands, women now find themselves alone and defiled by too many sex partners to remember; having been promised liberation from the duties of the home (which feminist Betty Friedan likened to a “comfortable concentration camp”), women now find themselves in cheaply furnished apartments with plastic plants and a dining table set for one.\\n\\nAs with other “minorities,” women have had gushing praise and endless entitlements heaped upon them, simply for being a female (although even the word “female” is now without clear definition). They have been given numerous financial grants and special privileges, have been told “the future is female,” and have been given total domination over petty mid-level administrative posts that allows them to exercise their vindictive cattiness in a myriad of new ways. They are praised for mediocrity, and are greeted with “YAS QUEEN” for acts usually bitchy or cruel in manner.\\n\\nhttps://theamericansun.com/2020/05/13/the-age-of-the-tiktok-nurse/amp/ ',\n",

During clinical always be reviewing and building up step 2, don’t wait till the end to then start reviewing.Doing the above will make not only passing but getting high scores on your boards much easier and u need that for competitive residencies.And don’t psych yourself out. You’d be amazed at how dumb some of the people are that get through med school. If your gpa is say a 3.3 or better in an undergrad science degree (I would even say a 3.0), you’ll have no trouble getting through.And another piece of advice: avoid negative people that complain about everything. Don’t get caught up in that bs. Keep your head down and get through and you’ll have plenty of opportunity to make good money doing something u enjoy. \",\n",

And at the moment, the only work I can get is in the hospital because my practice is currently closed because of fagflu, so now I'm falling behind on my loans and had to apply for a covid relief small business loan, which still hasn't had any action on it, despite having filed a month ago, as PPP ran out of money.If gay NJ keeps shut down much longer, I'll have to go chapter-11. \",\n",

       "   ' >>255453261Also it\\'s not necessarily the ventilator that kills people.The guidelines we\\'ve been using are based off of ARDS. When we treat ARDS we set people to breath about 6ml/kg for volumes and very high respiratory rates. This is because people with ARDS have \"stiff lungs\" which causes high pressures on the vent which causes barotrauma. When people with covid first go on the vent they do not have high pressures. They have fairly normal pressures. I\\'ve tried to even argue giving people big breaths during these early stages, but the docs wont listen to me because studies say otherwise. So about a week into mechanical ventilation, even with routine bronchial hygiene, these people get caked with this thick tan red-streaked mucous. It is unbelievably thick. Because these people had small volumes they develop atelectasis and this thick mucous fills their alveoli. Now theres no lung left to ventilate and these people have high airway pressures and can not oxygenate. Gas exchange only occurs at the alveolar level the rest of your lung does not. A common misconception is your lungs are like balloons when in actuality it\\'s more like a tree with a load of branches and lots of little balloons on the ends of those branches where leaves would reside. When those little balloons are filled with mucous or collapsed they no longer provide oxygen to your blood. ',\n",

They worship black retarded gorilla niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Niel deGrasse Tyson while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over.

They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers.

ICU RN working from LA.To simplify what she is saying, basically the medical staff where her \"friend\" works are providing treatment in a way that ensures that the medical staff is safe from getting infected at the unnecessary risk for the patient. There are steps to the kind of breathing treatment needs, from just needing a little bit of oxygen (air in general is only 21% oxygen and composed of other gasses) to straight-up needing not only a shit ton of oxygen (e.g. 40% of the air given at a time is oxygen) but also needing a machine to breath for you. It\\'s like from least helpful to total helpfulNasal Cannula (those nasal prongs, NC).Simple mask.(Parital) Non-rebreather mask (it\\'s the mask with the bag, designed so only oxygen is inhaled and CO2 is exhaled).CPAP.BiPAP (now you\\'re getting breathing assistance on top of oxygen aid).Endotracheal Intubation (\"Intubated\", ETT, short-term breathing aid)Tracheostomy (\"Trache\\'d\", hole in the neck for long-term breathing aid).So the staff where her friend works are skipping the less risky steps after a pt needs more than an NC and going straight to extreme shit like ETT, which can cause lung damage (\"Barotrauma\", lesions in the trachea, VAP [Ventilated-Associated Peumonia], broken off teeth, and etc.) from too-long improper pressure settings for the individual. There doing this because the infected droplets and air is contained within a closed system as opposed to be circulated in an extreme open system like the other air aids.There\\'s a lot to simplify here for you guys, so I\\'ll try my best to explain as the video goes on and whatnot.

First off, propofol (or any sedative medication like it) isn\\'t suppose to be used unless someone is being mechanically ventilated and even then it is suppose to be tightly titrated to an appropriate sedation level of the patient (see a scale like RASS)....MJ got it from a corrupt doctor so he can use it as a sleep aid without any professional medical supervision as well as mixing it with alcohol and him taking different not-measured YOLO amounts.Imo propofol is pretty great compared to other sedatives: it works quickly as does it stops quickly working compared to fentanyl and actually works unlike precedex.

It was his favorite job actually, not because of the beautiful scenery and relaxing environment of the front drivers cabin with the amazing view, he did not do this job because of the reasonable and stable pay packet, he did not do this job because he liked to choo-choo all day long and transport humans from Jo-burg to Durban, he did it because he wanted to see how many Niggers he could hit with his train before he retired. In 29 years of loyal human transporting service, my grandfather managed to hit and terminate 27 Niggers with his big giant and invincible-to-niggers train. They all died, he made sure never to brake. He told me that once he hit a big fucking she-kaffir baboon, probably weighed around 400 pounds, and when he stopped the train to inspect the damage to the front of the train he says that he could not find one piece of nigger flesh larger than a handful.

In recognition of his invention of the polymerase chain reaction(PCR) technique, he shared the 1993Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Michael Smith[4]Mullis expressed disagreement with the scientific evidence supporting the evidence that HIV causes AIDS,Mullis claimed the HIV/AIDS connection is due to a conspiracy of government agencies, and scientists attempting to preserve their careers and earn money, rather than scientific evidence. He questioned the scientific validity of the link between HIV and AIDS, leading some to label him an \"AIDS denialist” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_MullisIn other words the Nobel Prize scientist who invented the PCR technique behind the Covid-19 test, did not believe in the link between a positive PCR test of HIV, and disease. Therefore although the PCR technique is used in the Covid-19 RT-PCR Test, its Nobel Prize winning inventor who died in 2019, would claim the link between a positive Covid-19 and cold/flu/pneumonia like disease is a fraud like his view of the invalid positive HIV test and AIDS connection.“This means some of the biological markers being used to “flag” the presence of HIV are not “specific to HIV or AIDS patients [and] p24 and p41 are not even specific to illness.” In other words, healthy persons may test positive but not carry HIV at all”“The HIV/AIDS hypothesis is one hell of a mistake”, wrote Kary Mullis in 1996 [(1), p. 14].

       "   ' >>253320151>waiters do at the highest class of restaurants> class>dignitylol > This is the good side of hotel work. In a hotel a huge and complicated machine is kept running by an inadequate staff, because every man has a well-defined job and does it scrupulously. But there is a weak point, and it is this—that the job the staff are doing is not necessarily what the customer pays for. The customer pays, as he sees it, for good service; the employee is paid, as he sees it, for the boulot—meaning, as a rule, an imitation of good service. The result is that, though hotels are miracles of punctuality, they are worse than the worst private houses in the things that matter.> Take cleanliness, for example. The dirt in the Hôtel X, as soon as one penetrated into the service quarters, was revolting. Our cafeterie had year-old filth in all the dark corners, and the bread-bin was infested with cockroaches. Once I suggested killing these beasts to Mario. ‘Why kill the poor animals?’ he said reproachfully. The others laughed when I wanted to wash my hands before touching the butter. Yet we were clean where we recognized cleanliness as part of the boulot. We scrubbed the tables and polished the brasswork regularly, because we had orders to do that; but we had no orders to be genuinely clean, and in any case we had no time for it.>Dirtiness is inherent in hotels and restaurants, because sound food is sacrificed to punctuality and smartness. The hotel employee is too busy getting food ready to remember that it is meant to be eaten. A meal is simply ‘une commande’ to him, just as a man dying of cancer is simply ‘a case’ to the doctor. A customer orders, for example, a piece of toast. Somebody, pressed with work in a cellar deep underground, has to prepare it. How can he stop and say to himself, ‘This toast is to be eaten—I must make it eatable’? ',\n",

       "   ' Covid-19 is in fact not a pandemic, but a simulated virus within a international MCE (Mass Casualty Excercise) Drill. The test is only designed to detect any coronavirus so its a purposefully meaningless test for all strains of the common cold. They label anyone who dies with the virus as dying from the virus, the spread of the labeling procedure simulates the spread of a real virus.For the drill they empty the major hospitals, like NY’s Elmhurst hospital. They send home all non essential patients, resulting in a mostly empty hospital. The hospital is mostly empty because the number of people sick with flu/pneumonia/”Covid-19” like symptoms is still within the yearly variance for the flu (+/-40k deaths per year in the US on top of an average of 30K). Since, there is no extra patients, the hospital is mostly empty, and sits like an empty movie set, with empty tents, ERs, halls etc, awaiting the MCE drill.In the drill, the participants including the MSM, doctors, nurses, media relations etc., sign Non Disclosure Agreements(NDAs), with large fines and jail time if the NDA is broken. The drills include fake interviews with real doctors about Covid-19, done in concert with the MSM. The simulations also include medical dummies and crisis actors. The secret that there is no pandemic is kept from the participants by compartmentalizing the drill groups. Each group believes the drill is done in preparation for the real surge of patients. They are told that the other group got the real surge while their own group drills in preparation. Stock footage from the drills is put on to MSM. The media is known to use any footage that looks convincing and to use the same footage for mulitple events. Each group believes the other group must have got the real surge of patients, but they are restricted from disclosing information by signing NDAs, neither group knows there is never a real surge of patients, and neither group has enough information to prove it anyway.

The state board of nursing license search (https://appsmqa.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/HealthCareProviders) shows 36,532 active APRN licenses.However, it is common in medical circles to have social media profile using actual first name plus middle, maiden, or false last name. If we search for \"Erika\" APRNs in Florida, the list is much shorter: only 51 candidates (50 active).None in Naples, although her tweets also mention ORMC.

The test is only designed to detect any coronavirus so its a purposefully meaningless test for all strains of the common cold. For the drill they empty the major hospitals, like NY’s Elmhurst hospital. They send home all non essential patients, resulting in a mostly empty hospital. The hospital is mostly empty because the number of people sick with flu/pneumonia/”Covid-19” like symptoms is still within the yearly variance for the flu (+/-40k deaths per year in the US on top of an average of 30K). Since, there is no extra patients, the hospital is mostly empty, and sits like an empty movie set, with empty tents, ERs, halls etc, awaiting the MCE drill.In the drill, the participants including the MSM, doctors, nurses, media relations etc., sign Non Disclosure Agreements(NDAs), with large fines and jail time if the NDA is broken. The drills include fake interviews with real doctors about Covid-19, done in concert with the MSM. The simulations also include medical dummies and crisis actors. The media relations participants are required to go on social media and insist that the Covid-19 MCE drill is not a drill. Lying to the public is legal, as long as its done through the MCI drill run by the government of each nation, in concert with the MSM in each nation.mo dummieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_edZCFTDztQ ',\n",

When you lose a child, you're not in grief all the time. It feels unreal. It's an absurd situation. Most of the time you feel a sense of disconnect rather than an acute sense of grief. Everything is the same, yet everything is changed. It makes no sense. It doesn't mean you hang your end in tears 24/7. It doesn't mean everything about your normal behavior changes. It doesn't mean you never joke or laugh. You have moments when grief hits. Some moments are especially tough like moments at the funeral or when you directly have to deal with something that makes you intensely aware of the loss. But at other times life just feels normal and at the same time weird like you're dreaming but it's not a dream, and that feeling of weirdness only goes away after enough time passes and you get used to the changed reality. Real life is not a movie. Loss of loved ones does not erase the different characteristics that make the individual. There is nothing fake about people going from cracking jokes to tearing up. I would tear up when I didn't even expect it, but on the other hand at times I would feel nothing in particular when I would have expected to feel grief. Live and learn. \",\n",

       "   \" >>252249843Problem is we need to know how things changed over the day to get a proper idea of what's going on. Assuming this is BoJo...On admission his oxygen saturation was quite low. If you met a 30-year-old with no other conditions and his SO2 was below about 96% you'd be a bit suspicious something might be up.So let's say BoJo comes in and his oxygen saturation is 86%. We can tell how serious it is not by the initial figure but by how the figure reacts when we put him on oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. If you give him a bit of supplementary oxygen and it goes right back up to 98% you're not too worried, give him some hydroxychloroquine if you like (that's what we're doing in Ireland but we don't know if it actually helps much), keep an eye on him, he might be fine in a day or two and you can send him home to self-isolate for two weeks.If he's getting no improvement with extra oxygen you get concerned. You might have to knock him out and ventilate him because, with his lungs not working anywhere close to full efficiency, he'll get exhausted and collapse. It can happen quite suddenly.You don't want to do that if you don't have to because ICU is bad for you. You know how your muscles weaken and waste away if you're in a cast for a while? That happens with every muscle in your body when you're sedated for any great length of time.CRP being up just means he's sick, doesn't tell us a huge amount beyond that. Again, an isolated reading isn't all that helpful; you watch which direction it's going to see if things are improving or getting worse.The heart rate and blood pressure don't look super encouraging but we won't write him off just yet. The fever isn't exactly unexpected.The chest XR won't show you anything that the CT won't tell you in far more detail but it takes a while to get a CT done and interpreted, while the CXR can be done right now and everyone knows basically how to read them (except the psychiatrists, who might have forgotten) \",\n",

So in the end they break down after a shift of rushed sloppy work and feel like they saved 100 lives. It's annoying. >>252038732I work many different types of medical/care institutions - I get hired to fill shifts they can't fill with regular staff. So far I haven't seen anything even remotely close to the picture that's painted in the media of places like Spain or Italy here. What's worrying is the state of nursing homes - they largely just wait paralyzed for the first confirmed cases in the house and delay action until then, which is of course too late. Doctors increasingly direct contact with patients there and nobody gets tested. Not looking forward to working shifts in homes with 10 poor grandmas coofing themselves to death with no chance of being admitted to a hospital. Same goes for psych units, poor fucks. \",\n",

All day she would flirt around with less appealing men while she was engaged to a a fire chief that was going to build the both of them a house.Her most annoying quality was being super condescending about her job. We worked in a trauma 4 hospital, one of the last hospitals you would be dropped off at if you had an emergency. All day she would complain that she did the job of a custodian and did no real 'nurse' work. She was currently starting to transition to our city's owned hospital that was 10x more busy and way more difficult to work at (for less pay mind you).Anyhow, about 2 weeks before she's jumping ship we get a pretty big call that an ambulance is bringing in an old man that has a prolapsed anus and is so dirty that the bedbugs in his apartment are infecting his traffic coned shitter. The charge nurse and nurse that annoyed me get the guy and shove him into a room in the ER. Instead of decontaminating the asshole (literally) they throw a towel underneath his door and lock it so no 'contaminates' can escape. The two begin watching Netflix and never inform the doctor of his arrival. About 2 hours they leave this guy unattended and keep shutting off his nurse requests. Eventually day shift comes in and they forge the nurse digital board saying he only came in 15 minutes ago and they didn't have time to decontaminate the dude. Eventually day shift takes over and sorts the gentleman out. If you wanted to know the shit placed effort hospital staff takes, I have largely seen the first example. Then the hospital charges you out the ass, which only makes you despise going back in even more. These nurses are coming out and complaining because now they can't ignore the sick or leave them alone in their room. They gotta get out and do their fucking job. \",\n",

It's fucking up the sort of people who can't cope with 'flu, but unlike 'flu it's fucking all of them at the same time.

We're happy because we get free car parking, free lunches and free hotel stays. 80% of the clinical staff are essentially coming in to do quizzes and drink coffee, waiting to be redeployed as needed. Which in England means they are waiting for their order to ship down to London and help out there because London is fucked and we are not. We had 60 in ITU on Friday.

The death rate as of Friday - so keep in mind I haven't got a clue what happened over the weekend - was 10% which seems about right for corona chan. Should we have shut everything down to extend the lives of at risk patients by a year? Dunno. That's not something we think about in medicine.

In London, that means they are facing down one hundred times the regular capacity. So folks are dropping like flies. The data isn't available for the figures by Trust thus far, but I do know someone who's mother died down there and their triage was brutally honest. With Nightingale open, they should cope, fingers crossed. 4000 ITU beds is what they needed, plus the Brompton is now 100% ITU.

       "   ' >>251538146How about this one?Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext>The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 dayshttps://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/content/societyinfoAnother no name egyptian journal?

Looking into this situation myself, it seems that these papers focus on in vitro infectivity, which is a very poor model of in vivo epithelial infection. Even if we assume that the methods for detecting a cell which is expressing virus protein is valid, the simple fact remains that this does not prove that the virus itself is functional. This is simply because, in vitro, you can literally just apply raw DNA or RNA to cell lines and the cells will usually express these constructs, although with diminished efficiency compared to chemical transfection (with lipofectamine or something similar) or genuine viral transduction. In other words, they may simply be measuring the physical stability of viral remains, not the functional viability of the virus itself. \",\n",

The hospitals I work at are all lock step, and I have 5 employers across an entire state. Hospitals, just like local news, gets their 4am lunchable instructions.

People are forced to take them either way. Let that sink in. I have seen hundreds of people on a ventilator a week or two after a flu shot in my career. Half the Doctors I work with are complete low self esteem narcissists that will do anything to take ski trips to the alps. The best Doctors are like good cops, they dont stick around very long and find greener pastures. 50-70% of admitted pts in hospitals are dealing with complications from acute or chronic inflammation, something that is resolved within 24-48 hours by restricting calorie intake.

       "   ' WATCH IT – DESPICABLE ANTI-SEMITISM: Hasidic Jew Denied Service At Toyota “YOU ARE SPREADING THE VIRUS”Once again, as has happened throughout our history when there have been pandemic’s, Jews have been blamed for it. We knew it would only be a matter of time, but it happened, and thanks to this brave man, it was captured on video.A Hasidic man had an appointment on Monday morning to service hsi vehicle at Toyota in Goshen, NY, But instead of being serviced like the rest of the customers, he was told to leave because he was “spreading the virus”.The man says that he called Johnston’s Toyota if he can bring his vehicle in for maintenance. He was told it was not a problem, as they are open. He was given an appointment for 9:30AM. The Hasidic man arrived and pulled into the garage. A minute later, he was told by an employee to leave as they are closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.The man was suspicious, and pulled away and watched as one vehicle after the next was allowed into the business for service. He began video-recording the vehicles going in after being told they had closed. He the called Toyota dealership again and said “I missed my appointment, is there any time slot still available for today? Toyota told him “sure, come at 10:15 this morning”.STAY UPDATED WITH BREAKING UPDATES FROM YWN VIA WHATSAPP – SIGN UP NOW Just click on this link, and you will be placed into a group.He pulled in again, and a female employe told him to leave. He got out of his car and approached a male employee – possibly a manager – and questioned him why he was not being serviced. The manager simply responded “you are spreading the virus”…you gotta go buddy” The man then saw he was being filmed, refused to answer any questions,+ quickly walked away.Say hello to anti-Semitism 2020.https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1842063/watch-it-despicable-anti-semitism-hasidic-jew-denied-service-at-toyota-you-are-spreading-the-virus.html ',\n",
