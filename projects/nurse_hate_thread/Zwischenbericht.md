# **Nurse hate threads - "She's not a hero" **

### Background

Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic nurses (alongside doctors and other medical workers) have been celebrated globally for risking their health and working overtime in order to fight the virus. The work done by nurses has been subject to increased attention, which has led to a debate on their work conditions, wages, and the social recognition of their profession. 

The mainstream celebration of nurses has, however, also provoked hatred and frustration in sub-discourses. On the male dominated online imageboard [4chan](4chan.org) there has been a rise of discussion threads revolving around hatred against nurses. These threads mostly appear on the board /pol/ ("Politically Incorrect"). Such threads are often referred to as "nurse hate threads". The vast majority of these discussions combine the hatred against nurses with explicit misogyny; the nurses are mostly incapable, immoral or immature in virtue of being women. Importantly, these characterizations of nurses mostly aim at creating an antithesis to the figure of the hero. Nurses (predominantly in virtue of being women) are ridiculed as not skilled, moral, mature, or smart enough to be real heroes. Rather, they are assumed to exploit the current attention in order to stage themselves as heroes. Thus, they are not only framed as not having the properties of a hero. They are framed as the explicit opposite of a hero; a non-hero. 

### **Research question**

This project investigates how female nurses are described in online debate on the board /pol/ on 4chan. More concretely, I look closer at how nurses are negatively defined within this discourse as non-heroes. 

### **Research object**

All threads on /pol/ (4chan) containing the word "nurse", dating from the 25th of January to 8th of June 2020. This amounts to 116 threads including all comments. 

### **Empirical source: 4plebs** 

The threads on 4chan are ephemeral as they are constantly deleted from the website. To access posts dating back to January 2020 I have retrieved data from an archive of 4chan posts, [4plebs](archive.4plebs.org). This unofficial archive uses the software [Asagi](http://eksopl.github.io/asagi/) to save all the posts of selected 4chan boards. 4plebs uses Asagi to dump and archive all threads from selected 4chan boards, including /pol/. No threads are removed unless they are reported to contain child pornography (see [dost test criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_test#Criteria)), personally identifiable information (see [NIST definition](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf)), or copyrighted material not permitted under fair use doctrine (see fair use factors). 

There was written a script to scrape the text from all posts on the board /pol/ containing the word "nurse" (dating from 01.25.2020 to 06.08. 2020). This amounts to 116 posts with a total of more than xxxxxx comments.
