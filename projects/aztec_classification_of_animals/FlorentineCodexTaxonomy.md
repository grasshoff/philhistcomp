# Florentine Codex

In his ethnographic research, Bernardino de Sahagún obtained the help of two critical indigenous groups: the wise elders of numerous cities in central Mexico and the Nahua students of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco (which was the first European school of higher learning in the Americas)

The Florentine Codex covers the most diverse aspects of the Aztec society, e.g., history, religion, and medical knowledge; it consists of twelve books.



## Book XI: Earthly Things

Book XI, the longest in the codex, is a treatise on natural history. Following the traditional division of common knowledge in many European works, the Florentine Codex deals with everything divine, human, and natural of New Spain. Therefore, after having spoken of superior beings and human beings, Sahagún examines animals, plants, and all types of minerals.

The target of this project is the first five chapters of the penultimate book, which is called: [Earthly Things](https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10622/view/1/8/).



### Aztec Classification of Animals

Sahagún organized the work in two columns: on the right is the original text in Nahuatl and on the left, Sahagún's free translation into Spanish.

"Papalotl" means "butterfly" and as we can appreciate from the example, there are different words that contain the word "papalotl": 

1. Tlilpapalotl (black-butterfly)
2. Tlecôzpapalotl (will-go-up-butterfly)
3. Iztacpapalotl (white-butterfly)
4. Chianpapalotl (chia-seeds-butterfly)
5. Xicalpapalotl (gourd-butterfly)
6. Texopapalotl (blue-butterfly)
7. Xochipapalotl (flower-butterfly)
8. Vappapalotl (foliage-butterfly)

The goal is to present the Aztec taxonomy. In this example, "papalotl" is a general term, and the eight kinds of butterflies registered are specific terms. In order to understand how the Aztecs structured their classification of animals, we need to get from the most specific to more general terms. Following this logic, the questions are: 

- How many categories and subcategories are there?
- Which are the word roots?
- Which words of animals are used to form other names of animals?
- Can we recognize a hierarchy?
