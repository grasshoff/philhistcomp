# Background

In the branch of philosophy which is called "Social Epistemology" there is a debate about disagreement (especially disagreement between so called "Epistemic Peers"). A major question in the disagreement debate: What influence does disagreement have on one's own beliefs? Is it rational to hold on to one's own belief if someone else disagrees? In the literature inquiry is done by means of artificial examples, but real-world cases are rare. So, a real case might shed some new light on the issues of the disagreement debate.

Furthermore, in the disagreement debate the focus is primarily on disagreeing individuals which are competent, i. e. if they evaluate the truth value of a belief they are likely to be right. A high degree of competence is ascribed to scientists. What is stated in a scientific article is claimed to express knowledge. So, what epistemic impact has a scientist on another with which she disagrees?  Disagreement among scientists could be of much interest for the debate about disagreement.

The real world case I want to consider is the research on Chloroquine (CQ)or its derivate Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a possible treatment of COVID-19. The research is going on and there has been a somewhat controversial debate about the effects on people who suffer from COVID-19.
