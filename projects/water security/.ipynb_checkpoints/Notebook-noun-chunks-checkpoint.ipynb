       " Large-scale and uneven sand excavations not only decreased the river discharge from upstream but also allowed more tidal prisms to enter, which triggered severe saltwater intrusion.,\n",
       " Meanwhile, sea-level rise and changing wind patterns also contribute to increasingly severe saltwater intrusion, which was characterized by gradual increases in salinity, as well as more prolonged periods of higher salinity that exceeds acceptable thresholds occurring earlier in the year.,\n",

       " Adaptation to a changing climate is critical to address future global food and water security challenges.,\n",
       " While these challenges are global, successful adaptation strategies are often generated at regional scales; therefore, regional‐scale studies are critical to inform adaptation decision making.,\n",
       " While climate change affects both water supply and demand, water demand is relatively understudied, especially at regional scales.,\n",
       " The goal of this work is to address this gap, and characterize the direct impacts of near‐term (for the 2030s) climate change and elevated CO2 levels on regional‐scale crop yields and irrigation demands for the Columbia River basin (CRB).,\n",
       " This question is addressed through a coupled crop‐hydrology model that accounts for site‐specific and crop‐specific characteristics that control regional‐scale response to climate change.,\n",
       " The overall near‐term outlook for agricultural production in the CRB is largely positive, with yield increases for most crops and small overall increases in irrigation demand.,\n",
       " However, there are crop‐specific and location‐specific negative impacts as well, and the aggregate regional response of irrigation demands to climate change is highly sensitive to the spatial crop mix.,\n",
       " Low‐value pasture/hay varieties of crops—typically not considered in climate change assessments—play a significant role in determining the regional response of irrigation demands to climate change, and thus cannot be overlooked.,\n",
       " While, the overall near‐term outlook for agriculture in the region is largely positive, there may be potential for a negative outlook further into the future, and it is important to consider this in long‐term planning.,\n",
       " Near‐term outlook for irrigated agriculture in the Columbia River basin is largely positive; however, there are negative impacts as well The regional responses of irrigation demand to climate change is sensitive to crop mix; low‐value crops play a large disproportionate role While the overall near‐term outlook is largely positive, this need not necessarily extend further out into the future  The relationship between rainfall variability and economic growth is complex, and tends to be significant in economies like India where agriculture plays a major role in economic output and food security.,\n",
       " This paper seeks to provide insight into this relationship using Indian state-level economic and rainfall data from 1961 to 2012.,\n",
       " We examine all 15 Indian states with populations exceeding 20m as of 2000, totalling 920m people, about 12% of the global population.,\n",
       " Physical and human geography vary greatly between, and even within, these states, reflecting the global range of water security challenges and providing an analogue for a range of global economic development and environmental conditions.,\n",
       " We identify three patterns of interdependence between rainfall variability and economic growth: i) Continuous Correlation of rainfall and economic growth rates, ii) Decayed Correlation from a significant to an insignificant relationship, and iii) Never Correlated i.e. no significant observable correlation between rainfall and growth.,\n",
       " Sensitivity to rainfall variability is somewhat less in wetter states.,\n",
       " Investment in irrigation infrastructure has helped states to reduce their economic sensitivity to rainfall variability, with three of the four states that have Decayed Correlation of growth with rainfall having the highest percentage expansion in irrigated areas of the 15 states.,\n",
       " Greater use of groundwater supplies (rather than surface water) does not, however, appear to influence the sensitivity of economic growth to rainfall variability.,\n",
       " The relationship between rainfall-growth correlation and long term income is complex; states which are correlated generally appear to be growing faster than states which are not correlated, but that growth is occurring from a lower per capita income level.,\n",
       " Finally, confirming national trends for India, the paper does not find that economic diversification away from agriculture has reduced economic sensitivity to rainfall variability.,\n",
       " The observation that growth in economically-diversified states can still be dependent on rainfall invites further research into the ways in which rainfall either directly, or through other hydro-climatic variables, influences the general economy.,\n",

       " The area has recently faced a severe water deficit and KUKL’s existing infrastructure has had a limited capability, supplying only 19% of the water that is demanded in its service areas during the dry season and 31% during the wet season.,\n",
       " In this context, this study aims to assess the temporal trends and spatial distribution of household water security index (WSI), defined as a ratio of supply to demand for domestic water use for basic human water requirements (50 L per capita per day (lpcd)) and economic growth (135 lpcd) as demand in pre- and post-MWSP scenarios.,\n",

       " A simple and transparent conceptual framework has been developed to assess the European vulnerability to freshwater stress under the present hydro-climatic and socioeconomic conditions, in comparison to projections of future vulnerability for different degrees of global warming (1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C), under the high-rate warming scenario (RCP8.5).,\n",
       " Different levels of adaptation to climate change are considered in the framework, by employing various relevant pathways of socioeconomic development.,\n",
       " A spatially detailed pan-European map of vulnerability to freshwater shortage has been developed at the local administrative level, making this approach extremely useful for supporting regional level policymaking and implementation and strategic planning against future freshwater stress.,\n",
       " Understanding how water and solutes enter and propagate through freshwater landscapes in the Anthropocene is critical to protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems and ensuring human water security.,\n",
       " However, high hydrochemical variability in headwater streams, where most carbon and nutrients enter river networks, has hindered effective modelling and management.,\n",
       " We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France.,\n",
       " Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved carbon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations.,\n",
       " These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapolated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.,\n",
       " OBJECTIVE: To determine health service managers&#x27; (HSMs) recommendations on strengthening the health service response to climate change.,\n",

       " SETTING: Rural south-west of New South Wales.,\n",
       " PARTICIPANTS: Health service managers working in rural remote metropolitan areas 3-7.,\n",
       " MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of respondents identifying preferred strategies for preparation of rural health services for climate change.,\n",
       " RESULTS: There were 43 participants (53% response rate).,\n",
       " Most respondents agreed that there is scepticism regarding climate change among health professionals (70%, n = 30) and community members (72%, n = 31).,\n",
       " Over 90% thought that climate change would impact the health of rural populations in the future with regard to heat-related illnesses, mental health, skin cancer and water security.,\n",
       " Health professionals and government were identified as having key leadership roles on climate change and health in rural communities.,\n",
       " Over 90% of the respondents believed that staff and community in local health districts (LHDs) should be educated about the health impacts of climate change.,\n",
       " Public health education facilitated by State or Federal Government was the preferred method of educating community members, and education facilitated by the LHD was the preferred method for educating health professionals.,\n",
       " CONCLUSIONS: Health service managers hold important health leadership roles within rural communities and their health services.,\n",
       " The study highlights the scepticism towards climate change among health professionals and community members in rural Australia.,\n",
       " It identifies the important role of rural health services in education and advocacy on the health impacts of climate change and identifies recommended methods of public health education for community members and health professionals.,\n",
       " Diffuse nutrient loss is a serious threat to water security and has severely deteriorated water quality throughout the world.,\n",

       " Detection of diffuse phosphorous (DP) pollution dynamics under climate change is significant for sustainable water quality management.,\n",
       " In this study, the impact of projected climate change on DP load was analyzed using SWAT to simulate the future changes of diffuse components (carriers: water discharge and sediment; nutrient: DP) at both station and sub-catchment scales under three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).,\n",
       " Results showed that wetting and warming years were expected with increasing tendencies of both precipitation and temperature in the two future periods (2020s: 2021~2030, 2030s: 2031~2040) except in the 2020s in the RCP2.6 scenario, and the annual average increasing ratios of precipitation and temperature reached - 1.79~3.79% and 0.48~1.27 °C, respectively, comparing with those in the baseline (2000s: 2001~2010).,\n",
       " Climate change evidently altered annual and monthly average water discharge and sediment load, while it has a remarkable impact on the timing and monthly value of DP load at station scale.,\n",
       " DP load tended to increase in the non-flood season at Yuliang due to strengthened nutrient flushing from rice land into rivers with increasing precipitation and enhanced phosphorous cycle in soil layers with increasing temperature, while it tended to decrease in the flood season at Yuliang and in most months at Tunxi due to restricted phosphorous reaction with reduced dissolved oxygen content and enhanced dilution effect.,\n",
       " Spatial variability existed in the changes of sediment load and DP load at sub-catchment scale due to climate change.,\n",
       " DP load tended to decrease in most sub-catchments and was the most remarkable in the RCP8.5 scenario (2020s, - 9.00~2.63%; 2030s, - 11.16~7.89%), followed by RCP2.6 (2020s, - 10.00~2.90%; 2030s, - 9.00~6.63%) and RCP4.5 (2020s, - 6.81~5.49%, 2030s, - 10.00~9.09%) scenarios.,\n",
       " Decreasing of DP load mainly aggregated in the western and eastern mountainous regions, while it tended to increase in the northern and middle regions.,\n",

       " Selected studies focused on gastrointestinal illness associated with experimental infection by specific V. cholerae serogroups most often associated with epidemics and pandemics (O1 and O139).,\n",
       " Nonlinear dose-response model analyses estimated V. cholerae effective doses (EDs) aligned with gastrointestinal illness severity categories characterized by diarrheal purge volume.,\n",
       " The EDs and water exposure assumptions were used to derive Risk-Based Water Concentrations (CFU/100mL) for mission-critical illness severity levels over a range of water use activities common to military operations.,\n",
       " Human dose-response studies, data and analyses indicate that ingestion exposures at the estimated ED<sub>1</sub> (50CFU) are unlikely to be associated with diarrheal illness while ingestion exposures at the lower limit (200CFU) of the estimated ED<sub>10</sub> are not expected to result in a level of diarrheal illness associated with degraded individual capability.,\n",

       " Soils provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) that are crucial to food security, water security, energy security, climate change abatement, and biodiversity, especially in densely populated countries such as China.,\n",
       " At present, China is facing great challenges from serious soil heavy metal (HM) contamination which has damaged soil ESs and soil security.,\n",

       " After an introduction to the concepts of ESs and soil security and a review of the current status of soil HM contamination in China, the ESs that can potentially be provided by HM-contaminated soils are discussed.,\n",
       " Finally, we discuss the current remediation status of HM-contaminated soils from the standpoint of optimizing the ability of these soils to provide ESs.,\n",
       " The status of the provision of ESs by HM-contaminated soils of croplands, brownfields, and mining wastelands is described in detail.,\n",
       " Contaminated cropland soils fail to provide provisioning (e.g., food production), cultural, and regulating services, while the regulating and supporting services of brownfield soils are greatly reduced.,\n",
       " The ESs of mining wasteland soils have been severely damaged, resulting in a high potential for contamination of surrounding ecosystems.,\n",
       " Recent soil remediation projects have demonstrated that the damaged ESs of HM-contaminated soils can be restored, which would enhance Chinese soil security.,\n",
       " However, it has often been the case that only visible ESs (e.g., food production and vegetation cover) are addressed, while other less noticeable but important services (e.g., water quality and biodiversity) are neglected.,\n",
       " Therefore, we propose a framework for the evaluation of ESs provided by HM-contaminated soils.,\n",
       " The ESs that could potentially be provided by HM-contaminated soils would help to achieve soil security in China, not only by improving food security, water security, and energy security but also by helping to protect soil biodiversity and abate global climate change.,\n",
       " The ESs provided by HM-contaminated soils should be taken into account in soil policy and management systems as well as by the remediation industry.,\n",
       " Scientific findings confirm that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean are experiencing droughts and sea level rises that are contributing to saline intrusion of underground aquifers and surface water sources.,\n",

       " Interviews were conducted with professionals from multi-disciplinary backgrounds.,\n",
       " Also, data provided by the water agency were analysed to evaluate water governance practices.,\n",
       " The main contribution of this paper is the generation of a blend of policies, good practices and tools to confront growing threats to water security and to attain sustainable development in Caribbean SIDS in an era of climate change and increasing non-climatic stressors.,\n",
       " The paper concludes that economic, environmental and human resources, reformed administrative and legislative systems, and technological tools are fundamental to achieving good water governance.,\n",
       " Moreover, an array of complementary policies and technologies is needed to resolve water governance issues.,\n",
       " However, political will to implement sustainable water resources management is the greatest challenge in attaining SDG 6.,\n",
       " Several studies were carried out and drought coexistence technologies were developed to deal with the problem of drought in semiarid regions, such as the construction of underground dams, which became a tool for rural development, mainly for family agriculture.,\n",
       " However, there are still scarce informations regarding technical studies on the water security level of underground dams, especially about trace metal contamination due to the use and agricultural occupation of the soils downstream of the dams.,\n",
       " In this work, the level of contamination of trace metals in waters of underground dams, during two hydrological years, was evaluated around of the sub-basin of the Cobras river, in the Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil.,\n",
       " The analysis of the results indicated that the water samples stored in the Alexandre and Ginaldo underground dams are within the permitted drinking patterns and did not suffer, on the other hand, any alteration in their quality that requires treatment for human consumption, fitting into Class 1.,\n",
       " Most of the samples from the waters of the Boa Vista and Ademar dams are above the maximum allowable value for iron (Fe), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni), requiring a differentiated treatment for human consumption, and can be classified as Class 2.,\n",
       " The probable contamination of the waters stored in the underground dams may be of geological origin, since the largest accumulation of trace metals occurred in the lower area of the river course greater drained area, leading to believe that the metals come from the rock weathering that make up the geological framework of the region.,\n",
       " Reservoir and lake levels are susceptible to interference from inter-basin water transfer projects that are intended to alleviate increasing serious water resource crises.,\n",

       " The riparian buffer width is determined by Landsat NDWI.,\n",
       " Basing on in situ survey, the method that combing unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) and remote sensing (Landsat) was employed to calculate riparian biomass.,\n",
       " Results show that water arriving from the SNWD directly decrease the existing buffer width due to the rising water level, and riparian biomass shows a negative response to elevated water levels.,\n",
       " Therefore, the transferred water will impair the ecological functions of that buffer and increase risk to the security of the water resource.,\n",

       " Results and Discussions: This article is focusing one such efficient management of P resource addressing the major portion of phosphorus which is unnoticed in agricultural residues, manures, and other sources.,\n",
       " Increasing cost of phosphate fertilizer, a scarcity of high-quality phosphate rock (PR), and increasing surface water pollution are driving a need to accelerate the recovery and reuse of phosphorus (P) from various waste sectors.,\n",
       " Options to recover P occur all along the open P cycle from mining to households to oceans.,\n",
       " However, P recovery as a regional and global strategy toward P sustainability and future food, bio energy, and water security are in its infancy because of a number of technological, socioeconomic, and institutional constraints.,\n",

       " Overlying water, porewater, and sediments were sampled at 11 sites along the Yongding River.,\n",
       " Heavy metal concentrations were determined through ICP-MS, and sediments were subjected to a three-step sequential extraction procedure to verify the behavior of heavy metals through principal component analysis (PCA).,\n",
       " Sediments were separated into seven size fractions (&lt; 4, 4–8, 8–16, 16–75, 75–150, 150–250, and 250–840 μm) with sedimentation method based on Stokes’ law.,\n",
       " The characteristics of heavy metal distribution in different particle sizes were also explored using the Tucker 3 method.,\n",

       " Lead and Zn in porewater are higher than the criteria maximum concentrations (CMCs).,\n",
       " The IWCTUs of Pb and Zn indicate their possible risk of toxicity.,\n",
       " Principal component analysis reveals that Mn in sediments is preferentially associated with the exchangeable fraction, Cu and Zn are mainly associated with the reducible fraction, and Cr, Ni, and Pb are strongly related to the residual fractions.,\n",
       " Heavy metals in sediments mainly accumulate in the fine fractions (&lt; 4, 4–8, and 8–16 μm).,\n",

       " Abstract.,\n",
       " We present a new framework for modelling the complexities of food and water security under globalisation.,\n",
       " The framework sets out a method to capture regional and sectoral interdependencies and cross-scale feedbacks within the global food system that contribute to emergent water use patterns.,\n",
       " The framework integrates aspects of existing models and approaches in the fields of hydrology and integrated assessment modelling.,\n",
       " The core of the framework is a multi-agent network of city agents connected by infrastructural trade networks.,\n",
       " Agents receive socio-economic and environmental constraint information from integrated assessment models and hydrological models respectively and simulate complex, socio-environmental dynamics that operate within those constraints.,\n",
       " The emergent changes in food and water resources are aggregated and fed back to the original models with minimal modification of the structure of those models.,\n",
       " It is our conviction that the framework presented can form the basis for a new wave of decision tools that capture complex socio-environmental change within our globalised world.,\n",
       " In doing so they will contribute to illuminating pathways towards a sustainable future for humans, ecosystems and the water they share.,\n",
       " Abstract A unified co-evolutionary model was developed to study the adaptability conditions of regional water security systems, which is important for the coordinated development of these systems.,\n",
       " In this work, the main factors that affect the adaptability of regional water security systems, the contribution of each sub-problem domain to the development of the problem domain, and the fitness values of regional water security systems were analyzed based on the model.,\n",
       " Taking Jiansanjiang as an example, the results showed that in 2002–2011, the water resources system had strong adaptability and contributed greatly to improve the adaptability of the water security system; the socioeconomic system had poor adaptability to environmental changes and contributed little to the adaptability of the water security system; and the eco-environmental system was barely able to adapt to the changing environment and contributed less to the adaptability of the water security system.,\n",
       " Due to the influence of the socioeconomic and eco-environmental systems, the adaptability of the water security system was relatively weak.,\n",
       " Therefore, strengthening the sustainable utilization of water resources, promoting the coordinated development of the social economy, and improving the quality of the ecological environment are effective strategies to improve the adaptability of water security systems.,\n",
       " This paper attempts to understand and explore the problem of eutrophication in the context of agriculture with the help of a nexus perspective.,\n",
       " Eutrophication is significantly linked to water and energy resources with theoretically well-defined trade-offs and threshold levels.,\n",
       " While looking at the linkages between water and land resources comprehensively, our paper questions the present approach to designing and implementing watershed management, and analyses the effects of agricultural intensification, especially in dry regions.,\n",
       " Eutrophication is the process by which excessive nutrient loads in water bodies lead to undesirable water-quality problems and the degradation of the overall aquatic ecosystem.,\n",
       " Due to limited information and knowledge on water and soil quality in most countries, farmers continue to use fertilizers at an increasing rate and agricultural run-off has been carrying ever more nitrogen and phosphorus into water bodies.,\n",
       " This is likely to become a vicious cycle of eutrophication affecting food and water security.,\n",
       " Of late, soil- and water-conservation interventions, like watershed development, are further reducing run-off.,\n",
       " It is argued that there is a need to rethink the assumptions under which watershed interventions are designed and implemented.,\n",

       " While an increase in reliability is predicted for the SON season, the worst-case scenario is projected during the MAM season with a reliability reduction of over 40% for the 2055–2090 period.,\n",
       " This corresponds to a 27% reduction in water security for the same period.,\n",

       " RESULTS: Analysis of the review&#x27;s findings reveals that adaptations developed by built environment professions predominantly focus on protecting human health and wellbeing from the effects of climate change.,\n",
       " In contrast, built environment mitigations address climate change by embracing a deeper understanding of the co-benefits inherent in the interconnectedness of human health and wellbeing and the health of the ecosystem on which it depends.,\n",
       " In the final section, we highlight the ethical transition that these approaches demand of built environment professions.,\n",

       " Based on the obtained results, the best configuration is PV/FC/BS.,\n",
       " The optimal size and related costs for the optimal size are 235 kW PV array, 30 kW FC, 144 batteries, 30 kW converter, 130 kW electrolyzer, and 25 kg hydrogen tank is considered the best option for powering a 150 m3 reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant.,\n",
       " The values of net present cost (NPC) and the cost of energy (COE) are $438,657 and $0.117/kWh, respectively.,\n",
       " From the authors’ point view, the proposed system is one among the foremost environmentally friendly systems to provide electric energy to the seawater desalination plant, especially when connecting to the utility grid, because it is ready to reduce a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions due to using oil/nature gas in utility generation stations to reduce the effect of global warming.,\n",

       " The authors argue that a transformative water security approach that is generative of change is needed to deal with the many adaptation challenges experienced by floodplain systems.,\n",
       " They call for transformative water security that emphasises continuous experimentation and learning in an ongoing process of defining and balancing thresholds.,\n",

       " Change involves social and natural processes on a planetary scale that shape and transform local realities.,\n",
       " In this framework, the concept of water security must be understood as dialectically related to the concept of risk.,\n",
       " In the past few years, the concept of water security has been increasingly disseminated in Brazil, owing to severe droughts that have struck several of the country’s regions.,\n",
       " Between 2013 and 2015, South-East Brazil experienced the worst drought ever recorded there.,\n",
       " In North-East Brazil, a similar episode began in 2011 and still persists in 2017.,\n",
       " The impacts of these events, which are associated with climate risk and societal adaptation, have placed the issue of water security on the Brazilian political agenda, but decision makers’ conceptual approach is still fragile.,\n",
       " This chapter describes the Brazilian experience with water security that emerged from the water crises in two large metropolitan regions: São Paulo, in São Paulo State, the economic power of the wet South-East Region; and Fortaleza, in Ceará State, a semi-arid part of the North-East Region that has dealt with the impacts of drought throughout its history.,\n",
       " The respective droughts are described, as well as the water security strategies that were adopted during each of those crises, the lessons learned, and challenges for the future.,\n",
       " This chapter is about water security issues in urban areas of Latin America.,\n",
       " It argues that development of water infrastructure has been impressive, but insufficient to consolidate water security in the region.,\n",

       " The notion of water security in Central Asia has evolved throughout the years in an attempt to control an extensive transboundary river network which divides the region between upstream (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) and downstream (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan) countries.,\n",
       " In Soviet times, the belief in engineering and technical supremacy over nature was applied in the installation of numerous hydraulic facilities and mechanical interventions.,\n",
       " Water for energy was provided by a series of hydropower stations upstream, while downstream, extended supply and drainage networks and large pumping stations served mainly cotton monoculture.,\n",
       " After independence in 1991, water security in the newly established downstream states became synonymous with sufficient irrigation volume for agricultural production, while upstream, water security was interpreted as increased hydropower capacity.,\n",
       " Still, however, the transboundary nature of water resources in Central Asia determines to a large extent the need for coordinated national policies and compromises between the Central Asian countries for the attainment of water security in the region.,\n",

       " The approaches taken to water security by the countries of the Southern African region reflect their particular contexts.,\n",
       " There are two overarching challenges that are common to all these countries.,\n",
       " The first is the ongoing requirement to ensure that all citizens have access to safe and reliable water supplies, particularly in rural areas.,\n",
       " The second is to ensure greater resilience to climate variability, since drought regularly disrupts subsistence agricultural production, on which a substantial population still depends.,\n",
       " While floods have a significant local impact, they are a second-order challenge affecting a relatively small proportion of the regional population.,\n",
       " In this context, the principal barriers to achieving water security are economic status and institutional capacity.,\n",
       " The variability and relative scarcity of the water resource is, in itself, not the dominant determinant of water security, since there is evidence that the natural resource challenges have been overcome where there are competent institutions, able to access adequate financial resources.,\n",
       " There are also opportunities to mitigate some of the impacts of drought at a regional scale, but political barriers make it difficult to implement cooperative approaches for this purpose.,\n",

       " Women’s empowerment has been a key tenet of international water security programmes.,\n",
       " Discourses on water envision that enhanced access to water resources can transform disempowered women into successful rural entrepreneurs.,\n",
       " However, because such programmes often rely on simplistic representations of water, gender relations, and empowerment, they risk perpetuating and exacerbating gender inequalities.,\n",
       " Our study unpacks the storylines that drive water security interventions in the rural Global South, based on the case study of a donor-funded project in Nepal.,\n",
       " The latter explicitly aimed at empowering women by improving their access to water for domestic and productive uses and by transforming women into rural entrepreneurs and grassroots leaders.,\n",
       " We largely used qualitative methodologies, based on focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with households and key informants.,\n",
       " Fieldwork was conducted in two villages targeted by the programme located in two districts of Far-Western Nepal.,\n",
       " Our findings show that the gender myths and models that drive water security programmes, e.g. women as individual decision-makers and entrepreneurs, fail to adequately consider intra-household relationships and negotiations and the values that give meaning to women’s agency.,\n",
       " Such programmes tend to perpetuate predominant gendered norms, practices and unequal power relationships within households and communities.,\n",
       " We recommend that water security programmes rely on more nuanced and context-specific understandings of women’s empowerment that go beyond enhanced access to resources and agency to include knowledge, critical consciousness and values.,\n",
       " It is also important that such initiatives involve men and women – rather than exclusively targeting women – and initiate critical reflections on gender roles and masculinities.,\n",
       " In order to explore the applicability of the methods for protecting regional water resources, the water resources safety evaluation index system of Shandong Province was constructed, and the water resources safety relative closeness degree was used to characterize the water resources security situation of Shandong Province from 2008 to 2016; the matrix of water resources safety impact factors of Shandong Province was constructed.,\n",

       " Climate change is exacerbating existing water insecurity globally, with significant gender consequences.,\n",
       " Changes in water availability, access, scarcity and security play critical roles in shaping the ways that individuals, communities and countries are tackling existing and predicted climate change.,\n",
       " Although climate change is already increasing vulnerabilities, marginalisation, and sufferings of many across the world, impacts are unevenly felt across social strata.,\n",
       " Intersectionalities of social difference, especially along gender and class lines, differentiate the ways in which impacts of climate change are experienced and responded to.,\n",
       " This is particularly evident in water-related productive and reproductive tasks, as climate change is expected to exacerbate both ecological degradation (e.g., water shortages) and water-related natural hazards (e.g., floods, cyclones), thereby transforming gender–water geographies.,\n",
       " As such, it becomes imperative to undertake multi-scalar, critical and intersectional analyses to better inform both academic debates and policymaking.,\n",
       " Heeding gendered implications of climate change is particularly important as patriarchal norms, inequities, and inequalities often place women and men in differentiated positions in their abilities to respond to and cope with dramatic changes in socioecological relations and changing waterscapes, as well as foregrounds the complex ways in which social power relations operate in communal responses to adaptation strategies that are increasingly proliferating globally.,\n",
       " This chapter explores the nexus of gender-water-climate change to demonstrate how different groups of people understand, respond to, and cope with variability and uncertainties in a changing climate to reveal the challenges and prospects that exist.,\n",
       " Overall high annual precipitation in Sri Lanka belies significant spatial and temporal variation in surface water availability.,\n",
       " The ‘dry zone’ comprising two-third of Sri Lanka’s land area receives significantly less rainfall and has high precipitation rates and a five-month dry season.,\n",
       " Nevertheless, these regions account for the majority of rice production, the staple crop, thanks largely to the ancient hydraulic civilization based on networks of rainwater harvesting (irrigation) tanks.,\n",
       " This manipulation of surface water resources including modern surface irrigation schemes continues to form the backbone of dry zone farming.,\n",
       " Groundwater irrigation has remained in the shadows except in the North where surface flows are absent.,\n",
       " This scenario is now changing as population growth; poorly maintained infrastructure; commercial agriculture; sectoral competition for water and climate change combine to exert severe pressure on surface water resources.,\n",
       " Since the dry zone is also home to a large number of Sri Lanka’s poor households, and a close association exists between high poverty clusters and access to irrigation, the implications of water insecurity for a range of poverty indicators are clear.,\n",
       " Not surprisingly, these pressures have prompted an increasing recourse to groundwater in several parts of the dry zone, as governments and farmers recognize the imperative to increase agriculture output, promote crop diversification, and improve agrarian incomes.,\n",
       " Yet, with limited groundwater potential, limited detailed knowledge of this resource, and under-developed groundwater-oriented institutions, it is far from certain whether future groundwater exploitation can steer away from anarchy.,\n",
       " Due to the uneven water distribution around the world, population growth, high pressure over economic output (mostly food production) and an increasing number of sources of pollution, the use of water in international river basins will be under stress in the near future.,\n",
       " However, why we won’t observe a crescent number of acute conflicts or wars?,\n",
       " It is the opposite; States in the presence of water scarcity tend to engage into cooperative behavior embracing principles such as equitable and rational use to mention a few, but why?,\n",
       " This chapter takes an interdisciplinary framework comprised by international law and theory of international relations and a constructivist approach for analyzing the quality of cooperation over transboundary water.,\n",
       " The argument of the chapter is that the increasing sophistication in cooperation process over shared water produces important implications to international security in the river basins, thus, reaching the point of the formation of regional water security communities.,\n",
       " At empirical level, the chapter presents evidences of the existence of a water security community in the Okavango River Basin, which demonstrates that even in challenging political and physical environments, as in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, it is possible to achieve a high level of cooperation and institutional design that includes principles of governance and peaceful conflict resolution.,\n",
       " California’s water system has immense seasonal, annual, and geographic variability in hydrology and water demands and tremendous historical growth in population and dynamism in economic structure.,\n",
       " Although California’s situation would normally make it highly vulnerable to water shortages and floods, California has adapted effectively.,\n",
       " An extensive set of semi-autonomous local, regional, and statewide water management institutions supports extensive and diverse water management infrastructure and operations.,\n",
       " These diverse facilities and institutions are coordinated by an extensive web of regulations, water rights, contracts, and incentives, despite continuing challenges.,\n",
       " The resulting institutional and physical system has always suffered from the semi-aridity and variability of California’s climate, and is continuously challenged by long-term growth in population and shifts in economic structure and social objectives.,\n",
       " However, the political decentralisation of the system has brought steady local innovation, with larger episodic regional and statewide innovations accompanying the additional attention and focus brought by extreme events.,\n",
       " The high variability of California’s climate also provides frequent political motivation for large- and small-scale innovations in water management.,\n",
       " The result is a form of far-sighted incrementalism, driven by continuing problems and providing an unusual degree of water security for most of the state, though not all.,\n",
       " This paper describes how the rural development of a small village was enabled through the improvement of water security.,\n",
       " The rural village of Gwakwani in the Northern Limpopo province of South Africa was entirely dependent on a diesel powered borehole pump for their water supply.,\n",
       " The cost and unreliability of the diesel supply resulted in limited opportunity for the development and growth of the village.,\n",
       " As a rural community development enabler, a solar-powered borehole pump was installed in the village, which enhanced the availability and reliability of the water supply to the community.,\n",
       " A second solar-powered borehole pump was installed, which allowed the establishment of small-scale drip irrigation farming enhancing economic activity.,\n",
       " This paper presents the feasibility for the installation of solar-powered water pumps in rural areas, showing its advantage over diesel-powered water pumps.,\n",
       " It is shown how the availability of a reliable water supply increased the production of subsistence crops.,\n",
       " This paper concludes with a justification for installing high-tech solar pumping systems as a catalyst for developing rural communities.,\n",
       " As water scarcity problems grow in many Indian cities, civil society groups have been advocating rooftop rainwater harvesting for achieving water security.,\n",
       " They use it as a way to stop public investments on large infrastructure projects that are necessary for dealing with urban water scarcity.,\n",
       " Their perspectives about managing urban floods are even poorer.,\n",
       " The implications of extreme hydrologic variability for the effectiveness of water management choices we make for cities that experience floods and droughts have hardly been appreciated by them.,\n",
       " This chapter analyzes how the antagonistic view of some activists toward large water infrastructure projects, their obsession with “rainwater harvesting” as an approach for ensuring water security, and their increasing influence on the civil society at large weaken the institutional capability to evolve long-term strategies to deal with floods and droughts, using the case of Chennai city floods.,\n",
       " The chapter also examines the effectiveness of rooftop rainwater harvesting, especially the quantity and quality aspects of water collected through rooftops, and the technical feasibility and economic viability of roof water harvesting for mitigating droughts and controlling floods.,\n",
       " The Andes is the longest cordillera in the world and extends from northern South America to the southern extreme of the continent (from 11°N to 53°S).,\n",
       " The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension.,\n",
       " This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people.,\n",
       " In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth.,\n",
       " From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment.,\n",
       " In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range.,\n",
       " This review paper is presented in two parts.,\n",
       " Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation.,\n",

       " The countries of sub-Saharan Africa score very low on water security, affecting food production and water use for domestic and livestock sector adversely with an overall impact on the economy.,\n",
       " The region is riddled by conflicts, political instability, poor governance, corruption, politics of exclusion, high rural poverty, and weak human resource capacities and is not comparable with India when it comes to government policy making and public sector investment in water resources development.,\n",
       " But because of the heterogeneous conditions prevailing across India vis-à-vis agroclimate, socioeconomic status, and overall water security, the country’s experience provides important learnings for sub-Saharan Africa.,\n",
       " This chapter draws some important lessons on water management strategies for that region.,\n",
       " Finally, some policy directions are given for the fledgling economies of sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of South and Southeast Asia manage the political process of policy making well.,\n",
       " Coastal belt of India is prone to the problem of salt water intrusion.,\n",
       " This exerts a great pressure on the coastal residents, who need to look for alternate sources of fresh water to meet their agricultural and domestic needs.,\n",
       " Present study is an effort to understand the pattern of saltwater intrusion/inundation and the water security issues in the coastal belt of Thane district (Maharashtra).,\n",
       " Groundwater salinity has been observed and well proven by laboratory analysis of water samples collected from groundwater wells and spatially analyzed data to understand the underlying causes.,\n",
       " Physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the sampled water helped to draw correlation between various issues related to water security of the coastal community.,\n",
       " Salinity could be due to inundation or induced, which is because of heavy drawing of groundwater.,\n",
       " Various other factors like industrial waste disposal, local salt/clay pan may also be the other reasons of groundwater salinity.,\n",
       " Spatial analysis of well location with respect to the distance reveals that there is not much significant relationship existing between distance and individual physicochemical parameters.,\n",
       " However, the low lying area in the vicinity of creeks/back water (rivers) has impacted the low depth wells.,\n",
       " The low depth well (Veera) in the vicinity to creeks has been induced by saline water.,\n",
       " This induced effect is due to the failure in functioning of tide control measures such as gates (Vasant bunds) made at local level.,\n",
       " Due to the high salinity, cropping pattern has been changed and now farmers have restricted themselves to salt-resistant crops.,\n",
       " Analysis of well depth with respect to elevation and other physicochemical parameters depicts significant relationships that infers to the over abstraction of groundwater.,\n",
       " The study identified critical issues like inundation of sea water through creeps/back water (river) especially in the low laying regions, which can be avoided with the help of tidal regulation with gate operated bunds and subsurface bunds to avoid excess flow of groundwater to sea and reverse flow due to lowered hydraulic head.,\n",
       " Egypt is not plentiful in agriculture resources, whereby the total cultivated land is only 3.6 million ha, and total renewable freshwater is only 62 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) for 93 million people.,\n",
       " The water shortage in Egypt exceeds 30 BCM/year with Egypt’s water share per capita being 674 m/year.,\n",
       " This severe shortage of water resources and arable lands in addition to growing population are one of the reasons why Egypt is one of the largest food importers in the world.,\n",
       " Egypt is the biggest importer of wheat (12 million tons/year), and fourth importer of maize at 8.5 million tons/year and the seventh biggest importer of edible oils in the world, with a gap, reached 100% of lentil, 70% of broad bean, and 32% of sugar and 60% of red meat, butter, and milk powder.,\n",
       " There are several impacts of food and water insecurity and socioeconomic impacts such as the soaring price of food, and small and tiny farm.,\n",
       " More than 80% of land tenure and ownership is less than 0.8 ha in addition to very low share land per capita not exceeding 0.14 acres and continuous increase in poverty rate, which reached 27.8% at the end of the year 2016.,\n",
       " To deal with this food insecurity, Egypt counts on major reclamation projects for an addition of more than 1 million acres as an extension to the present agricultural land located in North Sinai, at Toshka in the southwest valley and the Oweinat project in the far south of the western desert near the border with Libya.,\n",
       " Agriculture related policies in Egypt should be reformed to plan and advance increased food production especially the essential crops such as wheat, maize, sugar, lentils and broad bean, oilseed, and meat and dairy products.,\n",
       " Moreover, Egypt should make serious efforts to find new sources of water to combat water shortage, which may include untraditional sources such as desalination of seawater, treated sewage and treated industry water, and reclaimed agricultural drainage water, and also develop and renovate the whole agricultural system.,\n",
       " Wetlands International is the only global nongovernmental organization (NGO) dedicated fully to the wise use of wetlands.,\n",

       " Due to rapid industrialization, urbanization and lack of awareness among people to consider water as a crucial commodity, around 80% of the world population is now facing water supply and security threat.,\n",
       " In fact, about 2% of planet water is fresh and only 0.036% of water is accessible for use, rest 1.96% is present in polar ice caps, underground wells and aquifers.,\n",
       " Furthermore, freshwater resources are progressively becoming unavailable due to huge amount of pollution in drinking water sources and also due to ignorance by human or industries and government authorities.,\n",
       " The increasing water contamination by discharging untreated effluent is major problem faced by humanity worldwide.,\n",
       " For this, government authorities and other organizations concerned about water conservation, awareness among people, strict laws about water security, sustainable and cost-effective wastewater treatment technology to overcome water pollution and water shortage problem for humans and biodiversity.,\n",
       " Identifying the sources of pollution and reducing the levels of contamination to improve water quality is a key priority to ensure long term water security for states and nations.,\n",
       " However, advanced water treatment technologies are still economically burdening for many developing countries, including Africa, putting human health at risk.,\n",
       " Implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), as cost effective alternative for water treatment is becoming widespread.,\n",
       " We present a review the potential of phytomaterials as a NbS approach for the treatment of water and wastewater, and along with brief analysis of phyto-filtration and phyto-coagulation technologies.,\n",
       " Using a case study approach, we illustrate an integrated eco-model that embeds local and indigenous knowledge with the scientific exercise, in order to design a community managed water and wastewater treatment systems.,\n",
       " The model could serve as a low-cost NbS solutions in the African context, as well as, in other developing countries.,\n",
       " The chapter provides hard evidence in support of the argument that policy reforms in the water sector that support investment in water infrastructure and institutions would be crucial for bringing about progress in human development in poor countries.,\n",
       " It uses findings from recent analysis of global data sets, corroborated by microlevel evidence of the various positive impacts of large water storages that can affect human development, economic growth, and poverty reduction, from intensive primary research carried out in one of the Indian states, particularly on one of the largest multipurpose projects.,\n",
       " The chapter also discusses about the determined attempts from some quarters in the recent past to misinterpret the concept of water sector reforms as an attempt to move away from infrastructure development and serious institutional change processes and policy measures, by merely parading vacuous slogans such as participatory management, “community management,” and “making water everybody’s business” and labeling them as “paradigm shift” in water management.,\n",
       " Water resources are, and have always been, a multidimensional resource that crosses all social and economic sectors.,\n",
       " Globally, growing population and urbanisation have increased the pressure to meet the water, energy, and food demands of larger populations with higher expectations.,\n",
       " As a result, both developed and developing countries seem to be racing against the clock to respond to the needs of societies in which inequalities continue to grow.,\n",
       " Water resources are scarcer and more polluted; their management, governance, and development increasingly depend on decisions that are made in other sectors, many times without sufficient coordination; and their availability is more than ever threatened by issues, such as climate variability and change, that impose nothing but uncertainty.,\n",
       " These factors have led to water resources being seen through the lenses of risk and security.,\n",
       " The security of water resources necessitates a departure from the status quo, to an innovative system that is able to understand and appreciate how different natural, policy, and political variables interact and affect each other.,\n",
       " This system requires a wholesome perspective that is able to propose alternatives that consider complexity and that are adaptive to an uncertain future.,\n",
       " A departure is necessary because the status quo has proven unable to respond to the present needs and expectations, much less to future ones.,\n",
       " From a hydrological perspective, Chile is a country of extremes.,\n",
       " Its rivers and aquifers exist in a wide array of geographical settings, and are characterized by presenting regimes of extraordinary variability in space and time.,\n",
       " From the driest desert on Earth to Patagonia, communities and ecosystems have adapted to endure periods of persisting drought, relentless precipitation, as well as favorable conditions for the emergence of a burgeoning agricultural sector.,\n",
       " With mounting evidence of global change processes, it is still unclear how these regimes will evolve in the future, and what are the challenges that water managers will need to face in order to balance increasing water demand and the need for water security.,\n",
       " This chapter describes the major hydrological regimes associated with water resource relevant regions in the country, highlighting the hydrological processes, variability and uncertainties pertaining to water resource management.,\n",
       " A global assessment of the state of hydrologic knowledge, data availability and future directions for research and management are provided.,\n",
       " Transboundary waters are a great challenge to water governance in a context framed by the sanctioned discourse (Allan 2001) of water crisis (e.g., Gleick 1993; Camdessus et al.,\n",
       " 2005) and the predictions of increasing disputes over water resources in the future (Wolf 1998; Giordano et al.,\n",
       " 2002).,\n",
       " This situation is sharpened by the great importance of surface river basins shared by two or more countries, which cover almost half of earth’s land surface and provide water for around 40 per cent of the world population (Wolf 1998; UN-Water 2008; Earle et al.,\n",
       " 2010).,\n",
       " In South America, a continent with three of the largest transnational river basins in the world, in area, flow and stream length—the Amazon, Orinoco and La Plata (Castillo 2011)—transboundary water security issues do not seem so acute compared to other regions such as the Middle East and North Africa, where water availability is already an urgent matter (Allan 2001).,\n",
       " Nevertheless, in South America processes such as agricultural frontier expansion, increasing urban populations and climate variability raise questions on water politics in the continent and the production of scales to address water governance (Tucci 2004).,\n",
       " Although markets are widely promoted as an efficient tool for managing water, little critical attention has been directed to the legal and governance issues of water markets, including matters such as compliance and enforcement, water accounting, and the overall effectiveness of water trading.,\n",
       " In response to these gaps, the chapter critically evaluates Australia’s cap and trade instrument, drawing on a review of the literature and survey and interview data collected from government and non-government stakeholders.,\n",
       " The findings reveal achievements, including flexible responses to past and future droughts; efficiencies that contribute to economic and environmental benefits; and increasing trade and market functionality.,\n",
       " Yet, the results also suggest cap and trade schemes are not functioning at the peak of their powers because of seven key flaws, namely a lack of robust regulatory underpinning; limited accuracy in water accounting; challenges in addressing universality of impact and source; queries over environmental benefits; lack of accounting for wider social impacts; windfall gains; and limited operation across Australia.,\n",
       " Some of these flaws are correctable, and the chapter pinpoints relevant areas for market policy reform.,\n",
       " However, a number of the identified flaws require water law and policy to look beyond markets.,\n",
       " The chapter argues in these areas, such as groundwater, complementary regulatory tools are needed to ensure Australia’s future water security and sustainability.,\n",
       " The term “water security” continues to gain traction in water resources literature with broad application to human health, water quality, and sustainability of water supply.,\n",
       " These western science applications focus almost exclusively on the material value of water for human uses and activities.,\n",
       " This paper offers voice to other interpretations of water security based on semi-structured interviews with Indigenous participants representing varied backgrounds and communities from Saskatchewan, a Canadian prairie province.,\n",
       " The results indicate that water security from an Indigenous perspective embraces much more than the material value of water.,\n",
       " Five themes emerged from this research that speak to a more holistic framing of water security to include water as a life form, water and the spirit world, women as water-keepers, water and human ethics, and water in Indigenous culture.,\n",
       " This broader interpretation provides a more nuanced understanding of water security, which serves to enrich the water security narrative while educating western science.,\n",
       " Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA or MGNREGS) emphasises on drought proofing, soil conservation, land productivity and water security as the principle areas for taking up works under the sub-head of natural resources development.,\n",
       " Converging MGNREGS with other programmes to contribute to agriculture growth has been a major policy concern.,\n",
       " This paper lays out a case for making MGNREGS more effective in strengthening agriculture, livestock and fisheries in rainfed areas.,\n",
       " It builds on the field experiences of WASSAN and Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network in engaging with MGNREGS and agriculture in rainfed areas across several states.,\n",
       " From this study, we found that MGNREGS is uniquely positioned to make a substantial contribution to drive sustainability, resilience and growth in rainfed agriculture, livestock and fish production systems.,\n",
       " Its strength lies in its universal presence, focus on labour, well laid out systems of payments, social audit and intensive coverage of rainfed geography.,\n",
       " The chapter also suggests that some boundary conditions for not compromising the constitutional mandate of MGNREGA.,\n",
       " Such expansion of scope of the Scheme without compromising its own objectives can potentially have a multiplier effect of its investments in achieving resilience and growth of rainfed agriculture.,\n",
       " Managing water and energy resources sustainably for agricultural growth, poverty reduction, water security, and energy security is about managing the democratic polity well.,\n",
       " Governments are generally enthusiastic about implementing programs that quickly catch popular imagination.,\n",
       " They do not show the patience to generate sufficient scientific evidence that support decisions in favor of such programs.,\n",
       " The recent government policies in the water, agriculture, and energy sector are not based on hard evidence.,\n",
       " The political leaders need to be educated about the long-term benefits of adopting science-based solutions.,\n",
       " There is also a need for strengthening the institutional regime that regulates the quality of academic research to prevent peddling of falsehood.,\n",
       " There is a critical need for academic institutions to develop good theoretical understandings of the science-policy nexus and strategies for managing the nexus that are capable of enhancing the accountability and policy relevance of scientific research.,\n",
       " Academic research institutions also need to be autonomous so that they can critically analyze government policies and programs.,\n",
       " For decades, the main goal of Singapore in terms of water resources has been to become water-secure.,\n",
       " As a result, water availability, accessibility, and affordability have traditionally been decided at the highest political level.,\n",
       " Singapore’s overall development is linked to a great extent to ‘blue development’, the amount of water available in sufficient quantity and quality and at affordable prices for the growing number of uses and users in every sector.,\n",
       " The city–state aims to be water-secure, self-sufficient, and resilient by 2060, when water consumption will be twice today’s level.,\n",
       " An important global city, Singapore will continue improving its economic and social conditions to match both local expectations and global prospects.,\n",
       " Trends indicate that it will become more urban, more industrialised, and more competitive, which will result in higher water demand.,\n",
       " Known for its key policies and innovations, Singapore will have to continue planning within a long-term framework to become water-secure and achieve its overall development goals.,\n",
       " Northeast British Columbia (NEBC) is estimated to hold large reserves of unconventional natural gas and has experienced rapid growth in shale gas development over recent decades.,\n",
       " This industrial development has the potential to impact the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater.,\n",
       " In this study, hazard-specific vulnerability mapping was conducted across NEBC to identify areas most vulnerable to water quality and quantity deterioration due to shale gas development activities.,\n",
       " Vulnerability represents the combination of a specific hazard threat and the susceptibility of the water system to that threat.,\n",
       " Hazard threats (i.e. potential contamination sources and water abstraction) were mapped spatially across the region.,\n",
       " The shallow aquifer susceptibility to contamination was assessed using the DRASTIC approach, while the aquifer susceptibility to abstraction was assessed according to aquifer productivity.,\n",
       " Surface water susceptibility to contamination was assessed on a watershed basis to describe the propensity for overland flow (i.e. contaminant transport), while surface water susceptibility to water abstractions was assessed using watershed runoff estimates.,\n",
       " The spatial distribution of hazard threats and susceptibility were combined to form hazard-specific vulnerability maps for groundwater quality, groundwater quantity, surface water quality and surface water quantity.,\n",
       " The vulnerability maps identify priority areas for further research, monitoring and policy development.,\n",
       " Legacy nutrient accumulation from excess anthropogenic inputs has become a serious environmental issue in many watersheds worldwide.,\n",
       " In this review, we provide a systematic overview of sources, legacy nutrient pools, watershed-scale water quality models, and agronomic and environmental implications of legacy nitrogen and phosphorus pools.,\n",
       " Hydrological, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic factors exert interacting controls on legacy nutrient dynamics in soils, sediments, and vadose zone/groundwater.,\n",
       " Most current watershed models do not effectively incorporate legacy nutrient dynamics, while models that consider legacy effect often have high uncertainty in their treatment of legacy nutrient dynamics.,\n",
       " In many intensively managed watersheds, legacy nutrients are a dominant and long-term (&gt;10 years) source of nutrients to receiving waters, as well as a potentially important nutrient source for crop production.,\n",
       " Many existing beneficial management measures have limitations for reducing legacy nutrient losses to surface waters due to appreciable differences in legacy nutrient forms, watershed storage locations, and temporal dynamics compared to those of contemporary nutrient inputs.,\n",
       " Recognizing the importance of legacy nutrients is necessary for developing sustainable watershed nutrient management plans for future food, bioenergy, and water security.,\n",
       " These plans require strategies to maximize use of legacy nutrient resources to minimize their loss to the atmosphere (e.g., N2O emissions) and surface waters.,\n",
       " Finally, this synthesis identified future research needs for improving the understanding, utilization, and mitigation of watershed legacy nutrient pools.,\n",
       " With large development optimism and seen as rich in water resources, Africa is—except for the humid equatorial area—an arid continent, dominated by vast savannas, which require skilful manoeuvring between unreliable rain, very thirsty atmosphere, sharpening droughts and low runoff generation.,\n",
       " With a four-folding population and six-folding water demand in just 70 years, the pressure on the water resources is rapidly increasing and already approaching basin closure level in several regions.,\n",
       " Since the bluewateris concentrated to transnational river corridors, food production is 95% rainfed, i.e. depending on green water in the soil; subsistence farmers’ yields remain low (some 1 ton/ha), and hunger is widespread.,\n",
       " An African green revolution is slowly developing as a water harvesting supported agriculture, foreseen to allow even three-folded crop yields.,\n",
       " Many countries cannot expect long-term food self-reliance, making national economic planning essential to secure an industrial development for generating necessary foreign currency.,\n",
       " Africa’s future is closely linked to its demographic changes, demanding due attention: both towards reducing extreme fertility; and to adaptation to the rapid expansion of middle-age population strata in response to growing life expectancy.,\n",
       " Currently, two blindnesses are blocking the road to a sustainable future: city planners’ lack of concern for megacities raw water supply; and the United Nations’ (UN’s) Sustainable Development Goal’s (SDG’s) total unawareness of green water’s crucial role for hunger alleviation.,\n",
       " Foreseeable water shortages will demand water-security oriented policies, based on blue water for urban, industrial and energy water supply; green water for food production; and widespread leap-frogging and water decoupling for manoeuvring water supply.,\n",
       " It is anticipated that by 2050, the global human population will reach nine billion (Rosegrant et al.,\n",
       " 2009).,\n",
       " Along with population growth, socio-economic shifts and changing dietary patterns will require global food production to double in the next 40 years to accommodate increasing levels of consumption (Sposito 2013).,\n",
