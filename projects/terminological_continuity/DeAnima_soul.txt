And, of course, having supposed that they are really distinguished from
the essence [of the soul], it is much more probable that they are also 
[really] distinguished from each other.

Sixth, because our soul is the form of the body.

Therefore, just as other forms
depend on the heavens in their operations and follow inï¬‚uence from it,
so also our soul and will.

Seventh, will and sensitive appetite are powers rooted in the same
soul.

For it is the same soul desiring in either case.

Moreover, the
same soul cannot at the same time desire contraries.

All the ancient pagans who asserted that our soul is material
and mortal especially erred in this question.

Just as they posited two gods, one
the principle of goods, the other of bads, so also they posited two souls
in us, one which necessitates to good, the other to bad.

For these powers are spiritual and of a higher order, for although our soul is the 
form of the body it, nevertheless, is not wholly immersed in the body but is raised 
from the body in some of its acts.

Nor is it repugnant that the same soul desire contraries through different powers, 
especially if it constrains the inclination of one power through the other power.
