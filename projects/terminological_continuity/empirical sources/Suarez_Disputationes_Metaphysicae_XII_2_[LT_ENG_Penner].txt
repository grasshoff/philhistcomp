                          procedatur, simulque declaretur qualis sit conveni-          and at the same time better to show what the agreement

                          est: sicut enim supra de principio dicebamus, ita           just as we were speaking above about principles, so also in
                          etiam in causa tria considerari possunt, scilicet res        the case of causes three things can be considered: namely,
                          quae causat; causatio ipsa (ut sic dicam) et relatio         the thing that causes, causation itself (if I may speak in this
                          quae vel consequitur, vel cogitatur. De hoc tertio          way), and the relation that either follows or is thought. There

                          enim inferius suum proprium locum in materia de              course of this section on causes. For it has its proper place
                          relatione. De aliis vero duobus dicturi sumus: primo         below in the discussion of relations. But we are going to talk
                          autem de causatione ipsa, per quam formaliter con-           about the other two things. [We will talk], ﬁrst, about the
                          stituitur causa in actu, et ex qua nobis innotescit          causation itself through which a cause is formally constituted
                     20   causa ipsa, seu virtus causandi.                       20R   in act and through which the cause or power of causing is

         Prima causae         2. Prima igitur deﬁnitio haec tradi solet, Causa            2. First, then, the following deﬁnition is usually presented:     The ﬁrst

                          ex Aristotele 2. Physicorum cap. 7. ubi sufﬁcientiam 25R     can be taken from Aristotle, Physics II, cap. 7, where the
                         1Latin text by and large follows the 1597 edition, with most abbreviations expanded and spellings modernized. Punctuation kept as is. I checked the
                      text against the Vivès edition for signiﬁcant variations. For recorded variants, A = 1597 edition and V = Vivès edition. Note that the Vivès edition does
                      not have marginal notes: many, though not all, of the marginal notes from the 1597 edition are included in the Vivès edition as italicised text at the
                      head of paragraphs.
                         2Numbers in angle brackets indicate page numbers in the Vivés edition for ease of reference, given that it is the most widely used edition.
                       Suárez, DM XII.2                                                                                                                 2
                      25  causarum probat ex eo quod per illas satisﬁt om-              sufﬁciency of the causes is shown from the fact that through
                          nibus modis quibus quaeri solet propter quid res              them one satisﬁes all the ways in which it is customary to
                          sit: signiﬁcat ergo causam esse id per quod satisﬁt           ask on account of what a thing is. This indicates, then, that
                          quaestioni propter quid. Unde constat dictionem               a cause is that through which one satisﬁes the question ‘on
                          propter quid non sumi illo speciali modo quo solet 30R        account of what?’ Hence, it is obvious that the phrase ‘on
                      30  dici de causa ﬁnali, sed generalius, ut comprehen-            account of what’ is not taken in that special way in which it
                                                                                                                           3
                          dat omnes causas. Haec vero deﬁnitio nihil fere rem           is usually said of the ﬁnal cause, but more generally so that
                          declarat; nam aeque obscurum est quid signiﬁcet               it covers all the causes. But this deﬁnition explains almost
                          illud verbum propter quid: nam si recte sumatur,              nothing of the matter. For what that phrase ‘on account of
                          solumsigniﬁcat habitudinem causae ﬁnalis, et illam 35R        what’ signiﬁes is equally obscure. For if it is rightly taken, it
                      35  ipsam non satis declarat, ut postea videbimus. Si             only signiﬁes the habitude of a ﬁnal cause, and it does not
                          vero sumatur fusius, comprehendit varios modos                sufﬁciently explain that, as we will see later. But if is taken
                          qua illis vocibus signiﬁcantur, ex quo, per quid, a           more broadly, it covers the different ways that are signiﬁed
                          quo aliquid est: unde solum imponitur nomen com-              by the terms ‘from which’, ‘through which’, and ‘by which
                          mune, non tamen explicatur communis ratio. Addo 40R           something is’. Hence, it only imposes a common name, yet
                      40  illam vocem in ea generalitate etiam posse com-               no common ratio is explained. I add that that phrase taken
                          prehendere principia quae non sunt causae, sicut              so generally can also cover principles that are not causes, as
                          Christus dixit Ioannis 6. Ego vivo propter Patrem:            Christ said in John 6: ‘I live on account of the Father’. In this
                          ubi non habitudo causae, sed principii tantum sig-            passage, it is not the habitude of a cause that is signiﬁed but
                          niﬁcatur.                                               45R   only that of a principle.
           Secunda    45      3. Secunda deﬁnitio, et valde communis est,                   3. The second, and much more common, deﬁnition is                The second
            causae        Causa est id ad quod aliud sequitur.         Quae re-         that a cause is that on which something else follows. This is        deﬁnition of
           deﬁnitio       ferri solet ex libro De causis, ubi non reperitur; et         usually referred to the book On causes, where it is not found.         cause is
           refutatur.                                                                                                                                          refuted.
                          potius videtur sumpta ex deﬁnitione principii supra           It seems that it is rather taken from the deﬁnition of principle
                          declarata ex Aristotele 5. Metaphsicae. Nam quod 50R          from Aristotle, Metaphysics V, explained above.4 For where
                      50  Aristoteles posuit primum loco generis, in illa deﬁni-        Aristotle put ‘ﬁrst thing’ in the genus position, in this deﬁni-
                          tione causae ponitur per terminum magis transcen-             tion of cause it is picked out through a more transcendental
                          dentalem, scilicet id: reliquae vero particulae, scil-        term, namely, ‘that’. But the remaining phrase—namely, ‘on
                          icet ad quod aliud, maniﬁeste aequivalent illis verbis        which something else’—is obviously equivalent to Aristotle’s
                          Aristotelis unde aliquid. Denique quod Aristoteles 55R        words ‘from which something’. Finally, what Aristotle said
                      55  sub disiunctione dixit, est aut ﬁt, aut cognoscitur,          with the disjunction ‘is or comes to be or is cognized’ is rather
                          satis confuse comprehenditur sub unico verbo se-              vaguely covered through the single word ‘follows’. For with
                          quitur: in hoc enim verbo non potest signiﬁcari sola          this word cannot be signiﬁed only consequence through log-
                          consecutio per illationem, alioqui conveniret deﬁni-          ical inference. Otherwise, the deﬁnition would also apply to
                         3In discussions of ﬁnal causality, I would usually translate the Latin phrase with ‘for the sake of which’.

                          ipsa expositione sumitur potissimum argumentum              against the deﬁnition: for that deﬁnition is no more a deﬁ-
                          contra ipsam deﬁnitionem: quia illa deﬁnitio non            nition of cause than of principle. Hence, it also applies to
                          tam est causae, quam principii: unde etiam con- 65R         privations. For change follows from a privation, unless per-
                     65   venit privationi: nam ex illa sequitur mutatio, nisi        haps it is said that the word ‘follows’ should be understood in
                          forte dicatur, verbum sequitur intelligendum esse           terms of inﬂux and dependency. In that sense the deﬁnition
                          per inﬂuxum et dependentiam: quo sensu constabit            will indeed stand, but it will be most obscure.

           germana        aliqui moderni, Causa est id a quo aliquid per se           is that a cause is that on which something else per se depends.    and adequate
        adaequataque      pendet. Quae quidem, quod ad rem spectat, mihi              This deﬁnition, as far as concerns the content, indeed seems       description of

                      5   probatur: libentius tamen eam sic describerem: 5R           proven to me. Nevertheless, I would prefer to describe it
                          Causa est Principium per se inﬂuens esse in aliud.          as follows: a cause is a principle per se inﬂowing being to
                          Namlocogeneris existimo convenientius poni illud            something else.5 For I think that it is more agreeable to place
                          nomen commune, quod propinquius, et immedi-                 in the genus position that common name that more nearly
                          atius convenit deﬁnito: hoc autem modo compara-             and immediately applies to the deﬁned thing. In this way,
                     10   tur principium ad causam: nam ens, et illud rel- 10R        moreover, principle and cause are compared to each other.
                          ativum id, quod absolute positum illi aequivalet,           For being, and that relative ‘that’ which taken absolutely is
                          remotissimum est. Per illam autem particulam, per           equivalent to being, is very remote. Moreover, with that phrase
                          se inﬂuens, excluditur privatio, et omnis causa per         ‘per se inﬂowing’ privations and all per accidens causes that
                          accidens; quae per se non conferunt, aut inﬂuunt            are not related per se or do not inﬂow being into something
                     15   esse in aliud. Sumendum est autem verbum il- 15R            else are excluded. That verb ‘inﬂowing’, however, should

                       to be a real distinction between the agent and the patient. As DM 18.7 makes clear, Suárez thinks there are immanent actions where what is acting and
                       what is being acted on are identical. Nonetheless, even in those cases, he thinks the effect is distinct from acting principle.

                          producentem et productam; quia non apparet ratio              and produced thing) is not sufﬁcient. For the reason why the
                          cur maiorem distinctionem requirat verbum depen-              word ‘depending’ requires a greater distinction than the word
                          dendi, quam producendi. Item unum relativum pro-              ‘producing’ is not obvious. Likewise, one relative is said prop-

                          relativam dependentiam: cur non idem sufﬁciet ad              for correlative dependence, then why not say that the same
                          dependentiam producti a producente? Non enim                  thing is enough for the dependence of a product on the pro-
                          producitur quatenus est idem cum producente, sed              ducer? For it is not produced insofar as it is identical with
                      25  quatenus ab eo distinguitur: ut sic autem habet 25R           the producer, but insofar as it is distinct from it. But as such
                          distinctam entitatem respectivam receptam ab alio:            it has a distinct respective entity from the other. Therefore,
                          ergo secundum illam vere pendet ab alio. Adde                 it will truly depend on the other with resepct to that. Add
                          quod secundum propriam rationem respectivam ha-               that according to the proper respective ratio the produced

                      30  respectivum a persona producente: et illud habere 30R         producing person. And it cannot have the former except it is
                          non potest nisi ab alio datum: ergo in illo vere pen-         given by another. In that, therefore, it will truly depend on the
                          det ab alio. Quid est enim pendere ab alio in aliquo          other. For what is it to depend on another thing in some being
                          esse, nisi non habere illud a se, sed datum et com-           except not to have that being a se but to have it given and

           Quid sit           7. Ad hoc ergo explicandum dixi, causam esse                  7. Therefore, in order to explain this I said that a cause        Whatit is
        proprie ab alio   quae inﬂuit esse in aliud: his enim verbis eadem res          is that which inﬂows being into another. For these words              properly to

                        esse per se primo communicato. Unde generatio           communicated. Hence, the generation of Christ as a human

                   100  non est effectio neque causatio (ut sic dicam) sed      therefore, is not an effecting nor a causation (if I may speak

                        ipsummet esse relativum illarum personarum tale         to this that the very relative being of those persons is such
                        est, ut essentialiter includat totum esse divinum,      that it essentially includes the whole divine being which is
                        quod essentialiter est independens: et ideo neque       essentially independent. For this reason the relative being
                   105  ipsum esse relativum potest dici dependens.             itself also cannot be called dependent.
