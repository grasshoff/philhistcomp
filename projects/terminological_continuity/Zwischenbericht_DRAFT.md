## Research Question



## What I have done so far




## What still needs to be done



## Challenges, Concerns, and Questions


## Directions for Future Research
The historical line drawn between medieval and (early) modern philosophy is only one example of the historians' tendency to divide the continuous development of philosophical thinking into distinct periods, each of them having a definite beginning and ending. Hence, future research could apply the method developed in here to other distinctions in the history of philosophy.
