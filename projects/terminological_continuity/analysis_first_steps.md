    * Sydney Penner's (2011) English translation of Su√°rez' *De Anima, Disputation 12, Question 2* (cf. pdf-file in subfolder "empirical sources")

    * removing all footnotes, page numbers, etc.

    * import txt-file ("raw data") into jupyter notebook (cf. txt-file Suarez_De_Anima_disp12_q2_[ENG_Penner]_TEST.txt)
    * transform text into list of sentences
