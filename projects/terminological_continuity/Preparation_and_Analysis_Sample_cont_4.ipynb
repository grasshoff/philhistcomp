therefore, that it is ﬁtting for human beings by reason of that power in which they supersede other animals.', 'The same thing is evident by experience, for human beings do not experience freedom in themselves except insofar as they use reason.', 'Also, since this part is spiritual, freedom belongs to the spiritual part.', 'Hence, St. Thomas in ST IaIIae.1.1 and the Teacher in Sent.', 'II, dist.', '24, cap.', '5, say that freewill in its proper signiﬁcation refers to a certain act, yet the term is carried over to signifying the principle of the act.', 'Hence, it now signiﬁes a power, as

partly in reason and partly in will; in reason as in a root and in will as in a formally free subject.', 'Each claim is proven.', 'For freedom consists formally in the will for it consists formally in indifference of election.', 'A human being is free for thereasonthathecanelecteitherthisorthat.', 'Italsoconsistsinafreeuse of his own operations.', 'But to elect and to use other powers belongs to the will, as is obvious.', 'Therefore, freedom formally belongs to the will.', 'Andeveryoperation is thought free only insofar as it is subjected to the will.', 'But that this freedom arises from reason is obvious in the ﬁrst place, because desire arises from cognition, as was shown above.', 'Therefore, the mode of desire and of that will also arise from the mode and proper- ties of the cognized.', '10.', 'But it is necessary to explain in particular how freedom in the will arises from reason.', 'The Thomists commonly explain that the freedom of the will arises from the indifference of the intellect.', 'For that reason — they say — the will can love something or not love it, because the intellect is not necessitated to judging that thing to be better.', 'Rather, the intellect can ﬁnd some aspect of good and some aspect of bad in the object.', 'St. Thomas seems to teach this view in ST Ia.83.1, where he says that brute animals do not have freedom because they do not act by the judgement of reason.', 'But human beings have free will, because they act by the judgement of reason because it has the power for opposites.', 'It is also proven by reason, for freedom of the will consists in being able to love and not to love an object once proposed as good.', 'But it cannot do this as it pleases.', 'Rather, it can only love it insofar as it ﬁnds some aspect of good and it can only not love it insofar as it ﬁnds some aspect of bad.', 'Therefore, freedom consists in this, namely, that both aspects of good and of bad can be found in the same object.', 'It is conﬁrmed: for if the intellect were to cognize some good in the love for which it could ﬁnd no aspect of bad, the will would not be able not to love it.', 'Therefore.', 'Francis Sylvester of Ferrara holds this view in SCG III, the last chapter, as does Soncinas in Metaphysics IX, q. 14.', 'And from this they infer that the will ought always to elect that which the intellect judges to be better and more agreeable, since it cannot reject something except be- cause it found in it some aspect of bad or of lesser good.', 'Their argument seems to be that the freedom of the will ought to be within the latitude of its object, which is the good.', 'But that way has a difﬁculty, for if this is true, the will is not more free than the intellect.', 'For just as the intellect necessarily assents to the true, so also the will loves the good to which no bad is communicated.', 'And just as the will can fail to love the good because it ﬁnds an aspect of bad, so also the intellect can fail to assent if the true does not appear certain but is mixed with falsity in a certain way.', 'Furthermore, it follows that, absolutely speaking, the will is not free, for it always follows the judgement of the intellect and must elect what the intellect judges to be better.', 'But the intellect is not free.', 'Therefore, neither is the will free.', 'Furthermore, this opinion is soaked in the opinion of Durandus, which almost all theologians disprove, namely, that freedom is formally in the intellect.', 'For insofar as freedom in the will arises from the indifference and freedom of the intellect’s judgement, freedom will be prior andmoreperfectintheintellect.', 'Another way of speaking is that the freedom of the will arises from the intellect, yet not from its indifference but from its perfection and universality.', 'For the intellect surpasses the other sensitive powers in this, namely, that it not just cognizes confusedly that this thing is agreeable, but that it distinctly perceives the aspect of agreeability, by separating it from all the other aspects with which it is conjoined and considering it insofar as it is desirable.', 'And from this perfection of cognition arises the perfection in the desire of the will.', 'For just as the intellect perceives in each thing how much goodness or badness it has, so the will can love it according to the goodness examined in it.', 'And for this reason those things which appear good are not loved necessarily but freely.', 'And all the particular things which occur in this life are of this sort.', 'For partic- ular things are never apprehended as necessary [goods], either because happiness is not placed in that in which it should be placed, because it is not actually considered, or, at least, because numerically these acts and this object are not deemed necessary.', 'From here, therefore, arises the freedom of the will.', 'And therefore whatever particular good is proposed to the will, it can love the good for the sake of the goodness that it has and it can fail to love it because it is not deemed necessary for happiness, at least here and now.', 'But it should be responded that it is one thing [not] to love and another to pursue hatred.30 Not to love implies freedom with respect to exercise.', 'And it is not necessary to ﬁnd an aspect of bad in the object for this; rather, it is sufﬁcient not to ﬁnd a necessary aspect of good.31 But for hatred it is necessary to ﬁnd some aspect of bad.', 'And the ﬁrst view — which should be explained rather than wholly repudiated — points in this direction.', '11.', 'From all of this, an apriori argument for the conclusion: for the will follows the rational and discursive power.', 'Therefore it is free.', 'The conclusion holds because free will follows on the intellect and reason, for, as is proven from what was said, the intellect apprehends the aspects of good and bad and of each thing it judges by what aspect and way it is desirable and good.', 'Therefore, appetite, which follows such cognition, will be able to love each cognized good by that aspect and way by which it is desirable and therefore [it will be able to love] freely.', 'It is conﬁrmed: for desire follows cognition.', 'Therefore, an appeti- tive power in the highest grade follows the cognoscitive power existing in the highest grade, and, therefore, freely.', 'But the intellect is such a power among the cognoscitive powers; therefore, the will among appetitive powers.', '12.', 'Whether the will and free will are really distinguished.', 'From which it is also proven that the will and freewill are the same in thing and na- ture.', 'They are distinguished just like intellect and reason.', 'For just as intellect is called intellect ﬁrst and absolutely, insofar as it understands or insofar as it understands (intuetur) a thing, strictly speaking, but is called reason insofar as it reasons discursively, so also the will is called such either insofar as it wills or insofar as it tends in a simple way to the end, but is called freewill insofar as it turns to means by free election.', '13.', 'In which acts or concerning which objects the will is free.', 'But concerning this conclusion we still need to explain in which acts and concerning which objects the will is free.', 'But this cannot be explained without discussing multiple theological questions at the same time.', 'And for that reason I say brieﬂy that willing with respect to exercise is one thing (it consists in being able to have an act and to cease from that act) and willing with respect to speciﬁcation is another (it consists in being able to have this act or its contrary, either love or hatred, or in being able to love either this thing or its opposite).', 'I say, therefore, that the will is determined with respect to speci- ﬁcation to the good and happiness in general, but not with respect to exercise.', 'The ﬁrst part is proven: for no aspect of bad appears in happiness or in the good in general so that the will could pursue hatred of it.', 'Thesecondpartisproven: for a love of this good or of happiness is never offered in this life as strictly speaking necessary and therefore the will is not necessitated to exercising it.', 'On the other hand, the will is not necessitated to any particular good in this life, neither with respect to exercise (because one does not plainly and clearly see a complete and necessary aspect of good in it) nor with respect to speciﬁcation (because there is no good in this life which is not mixed up with bads and difﬁculties).', 'Hence, the will differs in this respect from the intellect, for the intellect is not free in itself with respect to exercise, but depends on the motion of the will, as was shown above.32 But with respect to speciﬁcation, if the object appears evidently true, the intellect is necessitated to assenting.', 'But the will is not necessitated to loving something even if it appears evidently good.', 'This is because the aspect of truth is only one in kind and so, if a thing has truth, all falsity is excluded.', 'On the other hand, the aspect of goodness is not only one and so one goodness can be mixed up with other aspect of bad.', 'After this life, however, if a hu- manbeing attains the vision of God, it will be necessitated to a love for Godbothwithrespect to exercise and with respect to speciﬁcation.', 'For there no aspect of bad can be found, but always the most supreme and necessary aspect of good.', 'But in all other acts the will is free, as much in election as in intention for the end, although in different ways.', 'For con- cerning means it acts not only freely but with deliberation and counsel.', 'But concerning the end it acts without deliberation.', 'But about all these things one should talk about ST IaIIae, some of q. 1 and some of qq.', '9, 10, and 13.', '14.', 'Response to the ﬁrst and second arguments.', 'From here the so- lution to the ﬁrst and second arguments is proven.', 'I respond that the same power which operates freely concerning some objects can operate naturally and necessarily concerning other objects.', 'This is because it is a higher power and operates according to the exigency of the objects, just as the will of God necessarily loves his essence because that object is wor- thy of being loved that way but loves creatures freely because they are also worthy of being loved in this way.', 'So also our will proportionately.', '15.', 'Response to the third.', 'How God concurs with our will.', 'The third argument begs for a long treatise about the way in which God concurs withourwillinexercisingacts,naturalaswellassupernatural,whilepre- serving our will’s freedom.', 'Many theologians speak about this matter, whichcanbeseeninST Ia.19, 22, and 23 and IaIIae.109.', 'Nevertheless, I brieﬂy say, along with St. Thomas in the mentioned places as well as IaI- Iae.10.3, that since the will is free by its nature, God, since he is inﬁnite in wisdom and power, adjusts himself to the causes of things and concurs with each one in that way which its nature requires.', 'And thus he works with the will without necessitating it but leaving it to determine itself to what it wished and offering assistance and counsel to it.', 'Therefore, I respond to the argument in form, that once everything required has been posited in the ﬁrst act, the will can issue and not issue a second act.', 'For God, for his part, is prepared to concur with the will for the act which it wishes to effect.', 'It is in my power whether God concurs with me or does not concur.', 'And therefore, there is freedom in election.', 'Hence, when it is said that once the divine will is posited, the will cannot not act, it still carries through, nevertheless, that the will acts freely.', 'For that proposition has a compound sense and only posits a conditional necessity.', '16.', 'Response to the fourth.', 'I respond to the fourth argument that the will, when it acts, acts freely strictly speaking.', 'And when it does not act, it freely does not act.', 'For in that same instant in which it could act as far as it is concerned it could also not act.', 'In order to understand this the will should be considered in that instant in which it elicits an act as a nature prior to the act itself.', 'And this power as such freely determines itself to eliciting this act.', 'And after it is already understood under the act, it necessarily is under that act which then is, because the composite has been made.', 'And that is only the necessity of the consequence rather than the necessity of the consequent, since with that the freedom stands strictly speaking.', 'This argument is discussed more extensively in ST Ia.14.13 and 19.7.', 'And in this way freedom also remains.', '17.', 'Response to the ﬁfth. [', 'I respond to] the ﬁfth argument: for God does not know my free acts except insofar as they are in some way present to his eternity.', 'And in that way he knows them to be future, as they are, and his knowledge does not imply necessity except conditionally.', '18.', 'Response to the sixth.', 'The sixth argument introduces another difﬁculty: in what way the heavens have dominion over the operations of our will.', 'Concerning this matter, [see] ST IaIIae.9.5.', 'But this is not the place for discussing it in its entirety.', 'Nevertheless, I say brieﬂy that the heavens have an inﬂuence over the bodies of human being and over all corporeal powers, which intrinsically in their dispositions depend on thedispositionsofthebodies.', 'But,ontheotherhand,theheavensdonot directly have an inﬂuence or dominion over the acts of the intellect and will.', 'For these powers are spiritual and of a higher order, for although our soul is the form of the body it, nevertheless, is not wholly immersed in the body but is raised from the body in some of its acts.', 'Indirectly and, as it were, by consequence, insofar as reason follows sense and will fol- lows appetite, the heavens, inﬂuencing these material powers, indirectly and, as it were, by consequence, draw the will, not directly but by inclin- ing it.', 'Nevertheless, the will can through its freedom resist the inﬂuence of the heavens and have dominion over it.', 'As it is said: ‘A wise person will have dominion over the stars’.', '19.', 'In response to the seventh argument, so that we may oppose the impiety of Luther’s assertion that the concupiscence of the sensitive appetite is always a mortal sin and the will is always necessitated by the disordering of the appetite that remains after sin.', 'But the theologians provokethis and therefore it should be said brieﬂy that appetite and will are two distinct powers following different cognitions.', 'And for this rea- son they are inclined to different things.', 'And one draws the other after itself not by necessitating the other power but by inclining it in some way.', 'Nor is it repugnant that the same soul desire contraries through different powers, especially if it constrains the inclination of one power through the other power.', 'Concerning this matter, see ST IaIIae.9.2.', '20.', 'The eighth argument raises another difﬁculty, namely, whether God necessitates or compels the will.', 'Concerning this matter, [see] St. Thomas, ST Ia.89.1 and IaIIae.6.4.', 'I answer brieﬂy—for it is a theo- logical matter—that although the will of itself is free, it can, nevertheless, be necessitated by God, for ‘the heart of the king is in the hand of God and he can turn it wherever he wishes’.', 'For God is omnipotent and has dominion over the will.', 'Nor is what is brought up in the argument similar.', 'For a thing which operates necessarily is material and of a lower order and for that reason it is incapable of freedom of itself by its own nature.', 'For that reason, freedom cannot be conferred on it by God, for freedom has to be from something intrinsic.', 'For freedom expresses a certain intrinsic dominion over one’s own acts and for that reason it in unintelligible that freedom be attributed to something by an extrinsic thing.', 'But, on the other hand, necessity is from something extrinsic and therefore God can impose necessity on a thing that is free according to its own nature.', 'Nevertheless, God cannot impose violence on the will.', 'For violence express what is contrary to the will and inclination.', 'But the will cannot will something contrary to its own willing, for by the fact that it wills, it already has a willing and inclination to that.', 'And for that reason compulsion in the will implies a contradiction.', 'But there is more to be said about these matters in their places.', '']\n"
