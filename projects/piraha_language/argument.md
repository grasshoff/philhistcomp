# Background

The Pirahã language, spoken by the eponymous tribe of the amazonian forrest is widely considered to
be one of the most peculiar languages in the world, with a very small vocabulary and lacking words
for most things beyond experiental knowledge. The Piraha do not have a creation myth nor care about
the past beyond the people they have either met in person or someone they have met in person has met 
in person. Remarkably they also lack word for exact quantities, number words.

## Research objects

**research objects**: a corpus of conversations with members of the Pirahã tribe translated into english.

**research question**: Can the Pirahã language express arithmetic propositions or in other words can one do arithmetics in Piraha?

**hypothesis**: No.

**basis for the hypothesis**: For arithmetic propositions we need logical vocabulary and number words, and the Pirahã
language seems to lack some key logical vocabulary and completely lack number words.

Assuming that, in spite of lacking a word for "plus" and for "and", that the Pirahã understand the concept of
sum, we would have the following scenario:

**Assumptions**:
1. Meaning is use, I will assume that the meaning of words is determined by the way they are used which. As our research
data is composed of a certain amount of conversations I will use those to determine the meanings of the words that I
need to translate. 

2. Non-contradiction principle

3. Truthfulness of the proposed translations.


**Syllogism**:
Assumption "piraha can express arithmetics"
If piraha can express arithmetics it can express arithmetic propositions.
If piraha can express arithmetic propositions it can express simple arithmetic propositions like 
1 = 1
the translation for 1 = 1 in Piraha is hoi ia hoi
hence 1 = 1 = hoi ia hoi
hoi ia hoi can be translated back to 1 = 1. Hence from a true statement follows a true statement. So far so good.

But from 1 = 1 we can also derive hoi ia hoi, which can be translated back to 1 = 2, which is false.

Hence, using Piraha translations, we can derive both a true and a false statement when translating a simple arithmetic
proposition like "1 = 1". In other words, we can derive both "P" and non-"P" from a Q. Therefore our assumption,
that piraha can express arithmetics must be dropped, and the contrary is true. Piraha cannot express arithmetics.


hoi ia hoi can also be translated as 1 = 2
hence 1 = 1 = 1 = 2
but that is false.


1 + 1 = 2
hói (few) "plus" hói (few) ia (is) hói (few)

1 + 2 = 3
hói (few) "plus" hói (few) ia (is) hói (few)

from this would follow that
1 + 1 = 1 + 2

and

2 = 3, which is an inconsistency, needless to say, a mathematics holding such
internal contradictions would hardly take off the ground.

Concludingly it can be said that the Pirahã language does not allow for arithmetic propositions, at
least as we have historically used and developed the concept of arithmetic.
