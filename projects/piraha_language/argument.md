# Background

The Pirahã language, spoken by the eponymous tribe of the amazonian forrest is widely considered to
be one of the most peculiar languages in the world, with a very small vocabulary and lacking words
for most things beyond experiental knowledge. The Piraha do not have a creation myth nor care about
the past beyond the people they have either met in person or someone they have met in person has met 
in person. Remarkably they also lack word for exact quantities, number words.

## Research objects

**research objects**: a corpus of conversations with members of the Pirahã tribe translated into english.

**research question**: Can the Pirahã language express arithmetic propositions?

**hypothesis**: For arithmetic propositions we need logical vocabulary and number words, and the Pirahã
language seems to lack some key logical vocabulary and completely lack number words.

Assuming that, in spite of lacking a word for "plus" and for "and", that the Pirahã understand the concept of
sum, we would have the following scenario:

1 + 1 = 2
hói (few) "plus" hói (few) ia (is) hói (few)

1 + 2 = 3
hói (few) "plus" hói (few) ia (is) hói (few)

from this would follow that
1 + 1 = 1 + 2

and

2 = 3, which is an inconsistency, needless to say, a mathematics holding such
internal contradictions would hardly take off the ground.

Concludingly it can be said that the Pirahã language does not allow for arithmetic propositions, at
least as we have historically used and developed the concept of arithmetic.
