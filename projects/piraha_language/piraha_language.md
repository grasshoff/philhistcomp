## Frage bezogen auf die Daten

Question: Can a language without number words express mathematical sentences? If they can, how much more difficult 
does the absence of number words make it? What does this say about languages that do have number word language technology?
I will attempt to write a simple mathematical theorem in Piraha. 

Research Objects: A collections of sentences and words from the Piraha language.
