# INFORMANT: Aogioso
# COMMENT: Steve Sheldon early 1970s; Translations and glosses completed by Dan Everett 2009. This is a story about a small baby (Tixohóí) who during the night falls off the bed and near the fire. His mother (Kato) and father (Hoagaixoóxai) are sound sleepers and do not waken to his crying. The grandmother (Xaogoíso) who is telling the story is very angry as is her sister (Xigaoxixaihoái) and husband (Xopísi). The father’s brother (Xoii) is also angry at their sleepiness and threatens that because the mother is such a sound sleeper he will have sexual contact with her some night and she would never know it. The baby is not really burned nor hurt, and finally grandmother takes baby back to his mommy to be nursed and put back to sleep. When the baby is sleeping again, the grandmother also returns to sleep.

# SOURCE: 05_anthropologists.pa, 05 VISIT OF THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS.pdf
# INFORMANT: Itaibigai
# COMMENT: Two anthropologists from the Masen Goeldi have made three trips into the Piraha to study the culture.  Their names are Adelia (iAbi) and Ivelise (itaIai).  During their first visit they lived on the beach at the mouth of the Maici.  During their time there two children became very sick.  Kaogiai the son of Kaxai, and a new-born of Ahoogi's.  Kaogiai got better with medicine, but Ahoogi did not take the new-born to get medicine.  This upset the other Indians a great deal. The antropologists talk of Steve's return to the tribe and wonder if he will be angry.  The Indians are hoping that the girls will leave their goods behind when they go away.

# SOURCE: 07_birthofpesbaby.pa, 07 BIRTH OF PE'S BABY #2.pdf
# INFORMANT: Maigiphoasi
# COMMENT: Background information: The mother giving birth is about 14 years old, married to a man about 45-50. Her name is Pe, his is Hoagaixoxai.  The young girl's parents have gone on a fishing trip, and everyone is quite upset because they are not there to help look after her.  The baby is born down at the river, and the young mother is very weak.  She tries to come up to the river bank but nearly falls, so her husband calls me (Steve) to come with a hammock to get the mother.  She doesn't want to but we bring her up in the hammock anyway.

# SOURCE: 09_DeathofXaogioso.pa, 09 DEATH OF AOGIOSO #2.pdf
# INFORMANT: Iaibigai
# COMMENT: This text again tells of Aogioso's death, emphasizing the trip downriver to tell her husband Opisi, who was fishing for Piranha, and the group living at the mouth of the Maici. When Aogioso dies, Abagi (Oi is his other name) is the only Piraha available to help carry her up from the riber bank. Of course he cannot do this alone, so he and Steve go down river to get help.  His daughter Iogi, upon learning of the death is afraid that perhaps the Brazilians may have killed Aogioso and also her husband. 

### NOTE: Xaogioso appears to also be refered to as XaogiosohoagI, which also may mean Xaogioso's son.

# SOURCE: 10_Iohabi_dog_snake.pa, 10 IOHABI, THE DOG, AND THE SNAKE.pdf
# INFORMANT: Baigibohoasi
# COMMENT: This text was made as a letter to be sent to one of the Piraha ladies who was sick in Porto Velho.  It tells of Iohabi and her dog and husband nearly getting bitten by an anaconda snake. The major thrust of the story is the snake is still there and that no one should go hunt as they might be bothered as well. The husband's name is Opisi. She goes to tell her sister Ioixaihoi the news, and the sister in turn tells her husband not to hunt. The speaker of the text does not want her husband to go hunting either.

# COMMENT: Martins is one of the local regatonistas who comes up the Maice river to trade with the Indians and others.  He is notorious for being drunk a great deal of the time, and one time he stopped at the village very very drunk.  We encouraged him to stay overnight, as everyone was afraid he would wreck his boat if he continued his journey that night.

# SOURCE: 15_Opisi_getsadog.pa, 15 OPISI GETS A DOG.pdf
# INFORMANT: Tisahai
# COMMENT: This story tells of a dog that Opisi found on the Marmelos. It had been left there by Martins a Brazilian trader.  Opisi and Isabi were traveling in two canoes, and Opisi wants Isabi to take the dog so it will not interupt his hunting at night.  Isabi agrees, and on the way home the dog smells a rat and puts it into a paka hole.  Isabi thought it was a paka but when they dug up the hole he found only a rat.  Itaibigai is Isabi's wife, and Toohio is their 6 year old daughter.
