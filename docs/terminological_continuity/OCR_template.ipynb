      "of the dead—and I ask whether or not this thing that has been evidently\n",
      "revealed will occur necessarily in the way it has been revealed. If so, then\n",
      "it is not a future contingent. If [you say that] it will not occur necessarily,\n",
      "then against this I argue as follows: ‘This is being revealed by God” was at\n",
      "one time true; therefore, ‘This was revealed by God’ has been necessary ever\n",
      "since the moment of the revelation, in accord with the rule that every true\n",
      "present-tense proposition has a necessary past-tense counterpart; and it was\n",
      "not revealed as false, since then it* would* not* have” been* a* prophecy*;\n",
      "therefore, it is necessary for a thing revealed in this way to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second problem is whether an evident cognition of this sort can be\n",
      "caused in the absence of an intuitive cognition of the extremes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third problem is this: What sort of cognition of such future things did\n",
      "the prophets in fact have?\n",
      "\n",
      "QUESTION 4 261\n",
      "\n",
      "Reply to Problem 1\n",
      "\n",
      "To the first problem I reply that such a revealed thing will occur contingently\n",
      "and not necessarily; and I claim that it is able not to occur. And 1 maintain\n",
      "that (i) “This is being revealed’ was true at one time, and yet that (ii) the past-\n",
      "tense proposition, viz., This was revealed’, has been contingent ever since\n",
      "the moment of the revelation. /316/ In the same way, ‘Peter is predestined’\n",
      "is now in fact true, and yet after this moment ‘Peter was predestined” will\n",
      "always be contingent. And so I claim that the thing revealed by God is able\n",
      "not to be revealed by God and was able never to have been revealed by God,\n",
      "just as someone who is now predestined is able not to be predestined and\n",
      "was able never to have been predestined.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the rule in question, I claim that this rule has to be understood to\n",
      "apply when the present-tense proposition is just about the present and is not\n",
      "dependent upon the future. But now even though the proposition “This is\n",
      "being revealed by God’ is present-tense as far as the wording is concerned, it\n",
      "is nonetheless equivalent to the future-tense proposition ‘This will come to\n",
      "be’—more exactly, it is equivalent to ‘The future contingent that is being re-\n",
      "vealed will come to be’. And so the present-tense proposition and, likewise,\n",
      "its past-tense counterpart are contingent. For if one posits that the revealed\n",
      "thing does not occur, then one has to say that “This is being revealed by God’\n",
      "and ‘This was revealed by God’ were never true.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might object as follows: ‘This was revealed by God’ is now true. If one\n",
      "then posits that the revealed thing does not occur, then “This was revealed\n",
      "by God’ will be false. In such a case, the proposition changes from being true\n",
      "to being false without any change in reality. For the cognition, which was\n",
      "previously evident and is not now evident, remains the same, and so do all\n",
      "the other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 reply that there is no way for such a proposition, which is equivalent to a\n",
      "future-tense proposition, to change from being true to being false. Rather,\n",
      "if it is true at a given time, then it has been true at every past time; if it is false\n",
      "ata given time, /317/ then it has always been false. And so no such contraries\n",
      "or contradictories can be made true successively.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might object that the proposition ‘God is causing this’, referring to\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Ockham clearly means to say that such a proposition cannot change from being true\n",
      "to being false at any time before the time at which the revealed thing is to occur. So, for\n",
