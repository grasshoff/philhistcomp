In addition to this I considered that I was nourished, that I walked, that I
felt, and that I thought, and I referred all these actions to
the soul:  but I did not stop to consider what the soul was,
or if I did stop, I imagined that it was something extremely
rare and subtle like a wind, a flame, or an ether, which was
spread throughout my grosser parts.

Let us pass to the attributes of soul and see if there is any one which is in me?

I do not now admit anything which is not necessarily true:  to
speak accurately I am not more than a thing which thinks, that
is to say a mind or a soul, or an understanding, or a reason,
which are terms whose significance was formerly unknown to me.

And although possibly (or rather certainly, as I shall say in a
moment) I possess a body with which I am very intimately
conjoined, yet because, on the one side, I have a clear and
distinct idea of myself inasmuch as I am only a thinking and
unextended thing, and as, on the other, I possess a distinct
idea of body, inasmuch as it is only an extended and
unthinking thing, it is certain that this I [that is to say,
my soul by which I am what I am], is entirely and absolutely
distinct from my body, and can exist without it.

And also from the fact that amongst these different sense-perceptions some
are very agreeable to me and others disagreeable, it is quite
certain that my body (or rather myself in my entirety,
inasmuch as I am formed of body and soul) may receive
different impressions agreeable and disagreeable from the
other bodies which surround it.

But certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it
is only so to speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say
that its nature is corrupted, inasmuch as apart from the need
to drink, the throat is parched; yet in regard to the
composite whole, that is to say, to the mind or soul united to
this body, it is not a purely verbal predicate, but a real
error of nature, for it to have thirst when drinking would be
hurtful to it.

But it is quite otherwise with corporeal or extended objects, for there is not one of these
imaginable by me which my mind cannot easily divide into
parts, and which consequently I do not recognise as being
divisible; this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind
or soul of man is entirely different from the body, if I had
not already learned it from other sources.
