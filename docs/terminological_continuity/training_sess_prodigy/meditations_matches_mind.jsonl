{"text":"So the difference between this mode of thinking and pure understanding may simply be this: when the mind understands, it in some way turns towards itself and inspects one of the ideas which are within it; but when it imagines, it turns towards the body and looks at something in the body which conforms to an idea understood by the mind or perceived by the senses.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}

{"text":"Also, the fact that some of the perceptions are agreeable to me while others are disagreeable makes it quite certain that my body, or rather my whole self, in so far as I am a combination of body and mind, can be affected by the various beneficial or harmful bodies which surround it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"My sole concern here is with what God has bestowed on me as a combination of mind and body.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"For knowledge of the truth about such things seems to belong to the mind alone, not to the combination of mind and body.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"For the proper purpose of the sensory perceptions given me by nature is simply to inform the mind of what is beneficial or harmful for the composite of which the mind is a part; and to this extent they are sufficiently clear and distinct.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"However, with respect to the composite, that is, the mind united with this body, what is involved is not a mere label, but a true error of nature, namely that it is thirsty at a time when drink is going to cause it harm.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"The first observation I make at this point is that there is a great difference between the mind and the body, inasmuch as the body is by its very nature always divisible, while the mind is utterly indivisible.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"For when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any parts within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"Although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, I recognize that if a foot or arm or any other part of the body is cut off, nothing has thereby been taken away from the mind.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"As for the faculties of willing, of understand- ing, of sensory perception and so on, these cannot be termed parts of the mind, since it is one and the same mind that wills, and understands and has sensory perceptions.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"This one argument would be enough to show me that the mind is completely different from the body, even if I did not already know as much from other considerations.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"My next observation is that the mind is not immediately affected by all parts of the body, but only by the brain, or perhaps just by one small part of the brain, namely the part which is said to contain the \u2018common\u2019 sense.!", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"Every time this part of the brain is in a given state, it presents the same signals to the mind, even though the other parts of the body may be in a different condition at the time.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"When the nerves are pulled in the foot, they in turn pull on inner parts of the brain to which they are attached, and produce a certain motion in them; and nature has laid it down that this motion should produce in the mind a sensation of pain, as occurring in the foot.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"But since these nerves, in passing from the foot to the brain, must pass through the calf, the thigh, the lumbar region, the back and the neck, it can happen that, even if it is not the part in the foot but one of the intermediate parts which is being pulled, the same motion will occur in the brain as occurs when the foot is hurt, and so it will necessarily come about that the mind feels the same sensation of pain.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"My final observation is that any given movement occurring in the part of the brain that immediately affects the mind produces just one corresponding sensation; and hence the best system that could be devised is that it should produce the one sensation which, of all possible sensations, is most especially and most frequently conducive to the preservation of the healthy man.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"For example, when the nerves in the foot are set in motion in a violent and unusual manner, this motion, by way of the spinal cord, reaches the inner parts of the brain, and there gives the mind its signal for having a certain sensation, namely the sensation of a pain as occurring in the foot.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"This stimulates the mind to do its best to get rid of the cause of the pain, which it takes to be harmful to the foot.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"It is true that God could have made the nature of man such that this particular motion in the brain indicated something else to the mind; it might, for example, have made the mind aware of the actual motion occurring in the brain, or in the foot, or in any of the intermediate regions; or it might have indicated something else entirely.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"This motion produces in the mind a sensation of thirst, because the most useful thing for us to know about the whole business is that we need drink in order to stay healthy.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"It is quite clear from all this that, notwithstanding the immense goodness of God, the nature of man as a combination of mind and body is such that it is bound to mislead him from time to time.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
{"text":"This deception of the senses is natural, because a given motion in the brain must always produce the same sensation in the mind; and the origin of the motion in question is much more often going to be something which is hurting the foot, rather than something existing elsewhere.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Meditations"}}
