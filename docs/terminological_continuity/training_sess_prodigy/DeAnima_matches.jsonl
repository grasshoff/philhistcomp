{"text":"In the first place because to be [essentially] ordered to some- thing is a relational property; the soul, however, does not intrinsically  and essentially include a relation, otherwise it would be an accident.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Secondly, either by \u201cbody\u201d we understand matter-and that is  not right because an essential ordination to matter is common to all  forms-or we understand matter with an organic structure, and that is  not right because matter with an organic structure includes the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"3 This difficulty has an aspect common to all forms and an aspect that  is specific to the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The spe- cial difficulty concerning the soul, however, is whether or not the soul  should be classified with such things [as an accident or a power].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"4 Concerning the difficulty which occupies us, let the first conclusion  be: The aptitude that it has for informing the body is of the essence of  the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"Confirmation: The soul is essentially a part.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore,  [the soul is essentially ordered to a whole and to other parts of that  whole].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore, those who think that an aptitude to inform is a  property of the soul which follows from its essence are mistaken; for  certainly, if this aptitude followed from its essence, it would presup- pose an already fully constituted essence of the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Because, nev- ertheless, this aptitude to inform matter is common to all substantial  forms, it remains to be seen what uniquely pertains to the soul on this  point.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"5 Let the second conclusion to this be: The soul is essentially ordered  to an organic body, and in this it differs from other forms.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The soul therefore differs in the first place from the forms of  inanimate things because it has a more noble effect upon matter, con- stitutes a more perfect composite, and bestows on it a richer being  than other forms do.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And hence it differs in the second place because the soul re- quires that matter be disposed in a more eminent way than other forms  do.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"3, and it is characteristic of the soul to be the act  of a body that consists of parts of this type.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But other forms inform a  body of the same nature in all of its parts, but every soul informs a  body that has parts that differ from one another, as is obvious from  induction.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The reason [for this difference] is that, since the soul is a more  perfect form than the forms of inanimate things, it surpasses these  forms in operations since the form of an inanimate thing has one sim- ple and natural mode of operating without skill and variety; but the  soul has a great diversity in its works, and executes its actions in a  certain skillful and admirable way, and therefore it requires diverse  organs, the more numerous and nobler the more perfect the soul is.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But someone will object that the heaven has an organic body  and nevertheless its form is not a soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"There  is, therefore, a difference between the soul and other forms because  the soul informs an organic body and others do not.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"For just as the soul of a plant, through its diverse parts, also  constitutes distinct organic parts, so the whole human soul existing in  each part informs them in diverse ways.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"This can be understood as  follows: because from the power of the mode by which the soul in- forms the head it requires in it certain sorts of dispositions, and, if  some one of them is diminished, the soul immediately departs from it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Hence two kinds of organic structure can be distinguished:  One, being accidental and consisting in a diversity of accidents, the  other being substantial and consisting in the mode of informing of the  soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Similarly, \u201corganic body\u201d can be understood in two ways: \tIn one way it can be taken to be matter disposed for receiving  the soul, for just as the form of fire requires matter properly disposed,  so also does the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"However, there is a difference because the form  of fire requires dispositions of the same nature, but the soul requires  diverse dispositions in diverse parts, according to the different func- tions the parts are ordered to.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"This difference follows from another  difference, namely that the form of fire, for example, does not bestow  on the composite a grade of being above the corporeal sphere; but the  soul surpasses it and confers the perfection of life.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And so the soul is  said to suppose the body as its receptacle, not because a determinate  body would be constituted by another [substantial] form besides the  soul, but because the soul itself, insofar as it confers the perfection of  life, presupposes the perfection of the body brought together by the  soul itself according to diverse aspects, as we have noted [in our  commentary on] On Generation and Corruption, book 1. [", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"This form is nothing else but the  soul, and such an organic body is the living being itself constituted by  a soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And \u201corganic body\u201d in this sense differs from the first sense  because the former is formally, organically structured by its accidents,  but the latter is formally, organically structured by the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Hence the  former is placed in the genus of material cause for the receiving of the  soul, but the latter is constituted by the power of the introduction of  the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"In Aristotle\u2019s definition of the soul \u201corganic body\u201d can also be  understood in this second way; and thus it explains the quiddity of the  soul very well, for it states the proper mode of the soul\u2019s informing,  through which it is distinguished from other forms, and by reason of  which the soul requires accidental organic structure in matter.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"9 But perhaps you will say that in neither way can the soul possess  ordination to an organic body since in the first way an organic body  includes accidents; however, substance, since it is prior to and more  perfect than accidents, is not able to have an ordination to them, nor is  it able to be defined through them.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But, indeed, in the second way an  organic body is the same as the living thing, which is posterior to the  soul and includes it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore, the soul cannot have ordination to the  living thing nor be defined through it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Never- theless, the soul can be defined with reference to such a body because  accidents of that sort are prior to the soul itself in the genus of material  causality, although they are posterior in perfection; for, although the  order of substance is absolutely prior to the order of accidents, even in  the genus of material causality, nevertheless some accidents, with ref- erence to a certain partial substance, can be prior in some genus of  causality.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But it must not be thought because of this that the soul is or- dered to accidents; rather is it the case that the accidents themselves  are ordered to the soul by preparing a subject in which it ought to be  received.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And in this way [accidents] can enter into the definition [of  the soul].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"To the second argument, I respond that the composite is in- deed posterior to the form in the order of execution; nevertheless, it is  prior in the order of intention and final cause because the soul has an  intrinsic ordination to constituting the composite.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And thus  as potency is best defined through act, so also the soul is best defined  through its formal act, which is the constitution of a certain sort of  composite [i.e. a living organism].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"10 But you will ask whether the soul has ordination to the organic  body understood either as the whole or the disposed mater.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And thus the problem is  solved because the soul, by the same act, informs matter and consti- tutes the composite, and thus the aptitude for both is one and the same  thing, although it is conceptually distinguished by us.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"Accidents as prerequisites [for the information of the soul]  are necessary conditions.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"11 Solution to the difficulties raised above.---To the first difficulty the  usual response is that the ordination of the soul to the body, as well as  similar ordinations, is a transcendental relation, not a predicamental  one.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"This line of reasoning led Cajetan to say that according to Ar- istotle the soul is mortal, and thus he explains in a different way the  common and proper activity which we have explained following Al- bert in his treatise on Book 1 of On the Soul, Chapter 6 and Averroes.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"43 With respect to this it should be noted that activity of the soul can  depend on the body in two ways:  In one way it uses the body as a  subject and an instrument, as vision depends on a body.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"This explanation has a solid basis in the literal meaning of  Aristotle since, when he says that, if understanding is imagination or it  is not without imagination, the soul is not separable, he clearly means  that, if understanding is not without imagination, there is no  activity  proper to the soul, as is obvious from the third conditional proposition.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore, for the soul to have a proper activity, it is necessary that it  neither be imagination nor even necessarily require imagination.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"There- fore Aristotle recognizes that the intellectual faculty of the soul is im- material; therefore he recognizes the same is true of the soul; therefore  he recognizes the soul is immortal since to say that he knows the soul  is spiritual and is not immortal is ridiculous since these two are so in- terrelated that it is hardly possible to be ignorant of the second while  knowing the first.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"And because the  soul can have this activity, at least when separated from the body, it  follows that it is immortal.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But Cajetan does not notice that this proof  supposes what is to be proven since to prove that the soul has proper  activity, it is presupposed that it is separated, and this is what is at is- sue.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Thus Albert, thinking that [what Cajetan thought was the middle  term], is the middle term, said consequently that the soul in the body  can have proper activity in that sense.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Generally it is said  that, if understanding requires imagination simply and absolutely, the  soul could never exist without the body.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Nevertheless, I do not like this solution: \tl. Because it renders this line of reasoning completely useless  since it supposes two states in the soul and in understanding: one in  the body and another outside the body, and this is to presuppose what  is to be proven.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"In addition, it begs the question since according to this inter- pretation to say that the soul can understand without imagination is to  say that it can understand when it is in a separated state.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And he means  that, if understanding is imagination, that is an activity elicited by im- agination or is not without imagination, that is if it is an operation of  the same order as the operation of the imagination, and it depends on  it in the same way that other affections of the soul, for example anger,  joy, etc.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"If  this is the way it is, I repeat, understanding is not without the body,  that is, it is an activity common to the soul and the body and not ex- clusively to the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
