{"text":"In the first place because to be [essentially] ordered to some- thing is a relational property; the soul, however, does not intrinsically  and essentially include a relation, otherwise it would be an accident.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Secondly, either by \u201cbody\u201d we understand matter-and that is  not right because an essential ordination to matter is common to all  forms-or we understand matter with an organic structure, and that is  not right because matter with an organic structure includes the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"3 This difficulty has an aspect common to all forms and an aspect that  is specific to the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The spe- cial difficulty concerning the soul, however, is whether or not the soul  should be classified with such things [as an accident or a power].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"4 Concerning the difficulty which occupies us, let the first conclusion  be: The aptitude that it has for informing the body is of the essence of  the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"Confirmation: The soul is essentially a part.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore,  [the soul is essentially ordered to a whole and to other parts of that  whole].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore, those who think that an aptitude to inform is a  property of the soul which follows from its essence are mistaken; for  certainly, if this aptitude followed from its essence, it would presup- pose an already fully constituted essence of the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Because, nev- ertheless, this aptitude to inform matter is common to all substantial  forms, it remains to be seen what uniquely pertains to the soul on this  point.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"5 Let the second conclusion to this be: The soul is essentially ordered  to an organic body, and in this it differs from other forms.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The soul therefore differs in the first place from the forms of  inanimate things because it has a more noble effect upon matter, con- stitutes a more perfect composite, and bestows on it a richer being  than other forms do.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And hence it differs in the second place because the soul re- quires that matter be disposed in a more eminent way than other forms  do.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"3, and it is characteristic of the soul to be the act  of a body that consists of parts of this type.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But other forms inform a  body of the same nature in all of its parts, but every soul informs a  body that has parts that differ from one another, as is obvious from  induction.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"The reason [for this difference] is that, since the soul is a more  perfect form than the forms of inanimate things, it surpasses these  forms in operations since the form of an inanimate thing has one sim- ple and natural mode of operating without skill and variety; but the  soul has a great diversity in its works, and executes its actions in a  certain skillful and admirable way, and therefore it requires diverse  organs, the more numerous and nobler the more perfect the soul is.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But someone will object that the heaven has an organic body  and nevertheless its form is not a soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"There  is, therefore, a difference between the soul and other forms because  the soul informs an organic body and others do not.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"For just as the soul of a plant, through its diverse parts, also  constitutes distinct organic parts, so the whole human soul existing in  each part informs them in diverse ways.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"This can be understood as  follows: because from the power of the mode by which the soul in- forms the head it requires in it certain sorts of dispositions, and, if  some one of them is diminished, the soul immediately departs from it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Hence two kinds of organic structure can be distinguished:  One, being accidental and consisting in a diversity of accidents, the  other being substantial and consisting in the mode of informing of the  soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Similarly, \u201corganic body\u201d can be understood in two ways: \tIn one way it can be taken to be matter disposed for receiving  the soul, for just as the form of fire requires matter properly disposed,  so also does the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"However, there is a difference because the form  of fire requires dispositions of the same nature, but the soul requires  diverse dispositions in diverse parts, according to the different func- tions the parts are ordered to.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"This difference follows from another  difference, namely that the form of fire, for example, does not bestow  on the composite a grade of being above the corporeal sphere; but the  soul surpasses it and confers the perfection of life.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And so the soul is  said to suppose the body as its receptacle, not because a determinate  body would be constituted by another [substantial] form besides the  soul, but because the soul itself, insofar as it confers the perfection of  life, presupposes the perfection of the body brought together by the  soul itself according to diverse aspects, as we have noted [in our  commentary on] On Generation and Corruption, book 1. [", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"This form is nothing else but the  soul, and such an organic body is the living being itself constituted by  a soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And \u201corganic body\u201d in this sense differs from the first sense  because the former is formally, organically structured by its accidents,  but the latter is formally, organically structured by the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Hence the  former is placed in the genus of material cause for the receiving of the  soul, but the latter is constituted by the power of the introduction of  the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"In Aristotle\u2019s definition of the soul \u201corganic body\u201d can also be  understood in this second way; and thus it explains the quiddity of the  soul very well, for it states the proper mode of the soul\u2019s informing,  through which it is distinguished from other forms, and by reason of  which the soul requires accidental organic structure in matter.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"9 But perhaps you will say that in neither way can the soul possess  ordination to an organic body since in the first way an organic body  includes accidents; however, substance, since it is prior to and more  perfect than accidents, is not able to have an ordination to them, nor is  it able to be defined through them.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But, indeed, in the second way an  organic body is the same as the living thing, which is posterior to the  soul and includes it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Therefore, the soul cannot have ordination to the  living thing nor be defined through it.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"Never- theless, the soul can be defined with reference to such a body because  accidents of that sort are prior to the soul itself in the genus of material  causality, although they are posterior in perfection; for, although the  order of substance is absolutely prior to the order of accidents, even in  the genus of material causality, nevertheless some accidents, with ref- erence to a certain partial substance, can be prior in some genus of  causality.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"But it must not be thought because of this that the soul is or- dered to accidents; rather is it the case that the accidents themselves  are ordered to the soul by preparing a subject in which it ought to be  received.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And in this way [accidents] can enter into the definition [of  the soul].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"To the second argument, I respond that the composite is in- deed posterior to the form in the order of execution; nevertheless, it is  prior in the order of intention and final cause because the soul has an  intrinsic ordination to constituting the composite.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And thus  as potency is best defined through act, so also the soul is best defined  through its formal act, which is the constitution of a certain sort of  composite [i.e. a living organism].", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"10 But you will ask whether the soul has ordination to the organic  body understood either as the whole or the disposed mater.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"And thus the problem is  solved because the soul, by the same act, informs matter and consti- tutes the composite, and thus the aptitude for both is one and the same  thing, although it is conceptually distinguished by us.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"Accidents as prerequisites [for the information of the soul]  are necessary conditions.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}
{"text":"11 Solution to the difficulties raised above.---To the first difficulty the  usual response is that the ordination of the soul to the body, as well as  similar ordinations, is a transcendental relation, not a predicamental  one.", "meta":{"source":"Suarez, De Anima"}}

{"text":"When philosophizing about such important matters, however, it would seem to be excessively arrogant for us to assert that we have discovered the exact truth <where others have failed>; and so I should prefer to leave this claim on one side, and put forward everything that I am about to write simply as a hypothesis <which is perhaps far from the truth, so as to leave everyone free to make up his own mind>.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"In short, there is nothing in the whole of nature (nothing, that is, which should be referred to purely corporeal causes, i.e. those devoid of thought and mind) which is incapable of being deductively explained on the basis of these selfsame principles; and hence it is quite unnecessary to add any further principles to the list.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}

{"text":"For example, when the blood has the right consistency so that it expands in the heart more readily than usual, it relaxes the nerves scattered around 317 the openings, and sets up a movement which leads to a subsequent movement in the brain producing a natural feeling of joy in the mind; and other causes produce the same sort of movement in these tiny nerves, thereby giving the same feeling of joy.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"In the same way, when we hear good news, it is first of all the mind which makes a judgement about it and rejoices with that intellectual joy which occurs without any bodily disturbance and which, for that reason, the Stoics allowed that the man of wisdom could experience <although they required him to be free of all passion>.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"But later on, when the good news is pictured in the imagination, the spirits flow from the brain to the muscles around the heart and move the tiny nerves there, thereby causing a movement in the brain which produces in the mind a feeling of animal joy.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"Or again, if the blood is too thick and flows sluggishly into the ventricles of the heart and does not expand enough inside it, it produces a different movement in the same small nerves around the heart; when this movement is transmitted to the brain it produces a feeling of sadness in the mind, although the mind itself may perhaps not know of any reason why it should be sad.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"> Other movements in these tiny nerves produce different emotions such as love, hatred, fear, anger and so on; I am here thinking of these simply as emotions or passions of the soul, that is, as confused thoughts, which the mind does not derive from itself alone but experi- ences as a result of something happening to the body with which it is closely conjoined.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"Corresponding to the different ways in which the nerves are moved, or have their normal motion checked, various different sensations are produced in the mind; and this is how the various tactile qualities get their names.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"Moreover, when the nerves are stimulated with unusual force, but without any damage being occasioned to the body, a pleasurable sensation arises <which is a confused thought in the soul and> which is naturally agreeable to the mind because it is a sign of robust health in the body with which it is closely conjoined <in so far as it can undergo the action causing the pleasure without being damaged>.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"The nature of the mind is such that various sensations can be produced in it simply by motions in the body.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"It can also be proved that the nature of our mind is such that the mere occurrence of certain motions in the body can stimulate it to have all manner of thoughts which have no likeness to the movements in question.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}

{"text":"With the same paper, pen 321 and ink, if the tip of the pen is pushed across the paper in a certain way it will form letters which excite in the mind of the reader thoughts of battles, storms and violence, and emotions of indignation and sorrow; but if the movements of the pen are just slightly different they will produce quite different thoughts of tranquillity, peace and pleasure, and quite opposite emotions of love and joy.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"It may be objected that speech or writing does not immediately excite in the mind any emotions, or images of things apart from the words themselves; it merely occasions various acts of understanding which afterwards result in the soul\u2019s constructing within itself the images of various things.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
{"text":"We clearly see, then, that the sensation of pain is excited in us merely by the local motion of some parts of our body in contact with another body; so we may conclude that the nature of our mind is such that it can be subject to all the other sensations merely as a result of other local motions.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Principles"}}
