{"text":"As a result they strengthen the ideas of hatred which are already imprinted there, and they dispose the soul to have thoughts which are full of acrimony and bitterness.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And because the blood then entering the heart has come into the veins from the arteries, and so has passed through the heart many times already, it expands very readily and produces spirits whose parts, being 406 very equal and fine, are suited for the formation and strengthening of the impressions in the brain which give to the soul thoughts that are cheerful and peaceful.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The cause of these movements in the case of love I derive an explanation for all this from what IJ said previously, namely that our soul and our body are so linked that once we have joined some bodily action with a certain thought, the one does not occur afterwards without the other occurring too.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For it seems to me that when our soul began to be joined to our body, its first passions must have arisen on some occasion when the blood, or some other juice entering the heart, was a more suitable fuel than usual for maintaining the heat which is the principle of life.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"This caused the soul to join itself willingly to that fuel, i.e. to love it; and at the 408 same time the spirits flowed from the brain to the muscles capable of pressing or agitating the parts of the body from which the fuel had come to the heart, so as to make them send more of it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"This caused the spirits rising from the heart to the brain to produce the passion of hatred in the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"This produced the passion of joy in the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"In sadness 410 Sometimes, on the other hand, it has happened that the body has lacked nourishment, and this lack must have made the soul feel its first sadness (at any rate the first which was not joined to hatred).", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"In desire Lastly, when the soul was newly joined to the body, all its first desires must have been to accept things beneficial to it and to reject those harmful to it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"That is the reason why now, when the soul desires anything, the whole body becomes more agile and ready to move than it normally is without any such desire.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Moreover, when the body is in this condition, the desires of the soul are rendered stronger and keener.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And in general the soul is able to change facial expressions, as well as expressions of the eyes, by vividly feigning a passion which is 413 contrary to one it wishes to conceal.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For love makes the soul so engrossed in thinking about the loved object that it uses all the spirits in the brain in representing the image of this object, and it stops all the movements of the gland which do not serve this purpose.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It may also be caused by other passions It is true that hatred, sadness and even joy may also cause some listlessness when it is very violent, because it makes the soul wholly 418 engrossed in thinking about its object; this happens chiefly when these passions are combined with.the desire for something which we cannot do anything to acquire at the present time.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"How the passions which are peculiar to certain persons produce their effects For the rest, so as to put in a few words all the points that might be added regarding the different effects or different causes of the passions, I shall content myself with repeating the principle which underlies everything I have written about them \u2014 namely, that our soul and body are so linked that once we have joined some bodily action with a certain thought, the one does not occur thereafter without the other occurring too; but we do not always join the same actions to the same thoughts.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Regarding this, it must be observed that they are all ordained by nature to relate to the body, and to belong to the soul only in so far as it is joined with the body.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Hence, their natural function is to move the soul to consent and contribute to actions which may serve to preserve the body or render it in some way more perfect.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For it is only through a feeling of pain that the soul is immediately advised about things that harm the body: this feeling produces in the soul first the passion of sadness, then hatred of what causes the pain, and finally the desire to get rid of it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Similarly the soul is immediately advised about things useful to the body only through some sort of titillation, which first produces joy within it, then gives rise to love of what we believe to be its cause, and finally brings about the desire to acquire something that can enable us to continue in this joy, or else to have a similar joy again later on.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For all the animals devoid of reason conduct their lives simply through bodily movements similar to those which, in our case, usually follow upon the passions which move our soul to consent to such movements.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The function of these passions in so far as they belong tothe soul; 432 firstly, of love This would be sufficient if we had in us only a body, or if the body were our better part.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"But as it is only the lesser part, we should consider the passions chiefly in so far as they belong to the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For I acknowledge that hatred of the evil which is manifested solely by pain is necessary where the body is concerned; but I am speaking here only about the hatred which results from a clearer knowledge, which I refer to the soul alone.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Hence the hatred which takes us away from some evil likewise takes us away from the good to which it is joined, and the privation of this good, being represented to our soul as a fault belonging to it, arouses sadness in it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It is obvious too that joy cannot fail to be good, nor sadness bad, with respect to the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For the discomfort which the soul receives from evil consists wholly in the latter, and the enjoyment of the good belonging to the soul consists wholly in the former.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Joy and love, compared with sadness and hatred Moreover, since hatred and sadness should be rejected by the soul, even when they proceed from true knowledge, there is all the more reason to reject them when they result from some false opinion.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It seems to me that if we consider them just as they are in themselves with respect to the soul, we may say that although joy is less secure, and love less beneficial, than when they have a better foundation, they are still preferable to any sadness or hatred resting on an equally bad foundation.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The internal emotions of the soul Here I shall merely add one further consideration which, it seems to me, serves very well to prevent us from suffering any discomfort from the passions.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It is that our well-being depends principally on internal emotions which are produced in the soul only by the soul itself.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Although these emotions of the soul are often 441 joined with the passions which are similar to them, they frequently occur with others, and they may even originate in those to which they are opposed.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Neverthe- less he feels at the same time a secret joy in his innermost soul, and the emotion of this joy has such power that the concomitant sadness and tears can do nothing to diminish its force.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"To this extent it is certain that, provided our soul always has the means of happiness within itself, all the troubles coming from elsewhere are powerless to harm it.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And in order that our soul should have the means of happiness, it needs only to pursue virtue diligently.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For if anyone lives in such a way that his conscience cannot reproach him for ever failing to do something he judges to be the best (which is what I here call \u2018pursuing virtue\u2019), he will receive from this a satisfaction which has such power to make him happy that the most violent assaults of the passions will never have sufficient power to disturb the tranquillity of his soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Esteem, regarded as a passion, is the soul\u2019s inclination to represent to itself the value of the 444 object of its esteem, this inclination being caused by a special movement of the spirits which are so directed in the brain that they strengthen the impressions having this effect.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The passion of contempt, on the other hand, is the soul\u2019s inclination to consider the baseness or insignificance of the object of its contempt, and is caused by a movement of the spirits which strengthens the idea of this insignificance.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The result is that vain people attempt to humble everyone else: being slaves to their desires, they have souls which are constantly agitated by hatred, envy, jealousy, or anger.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"How generosity may be acquired It should be noted that what we commonly call \u2018virtues\u2019 are habits in the soul which dispose it to have certain thoughts: though different from the thoughts, these habits can produce them and in turn can be produced by them.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It should also be noted that the thoughts may be produced by the soul alone; but it often happens that some movement of the spirits strengthens them, and in this case they are both actions of virtue and at the same time passions of the soul.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"There is, it seems, no virtue so dependent on good birth as the virtue which causes us to esteem ourselves in accordance with our true value, and it is easy to believe that the souls which God puts into our bodies are not all equally noble and strong (which is why, following the vernacular, I have called this virtue \u2018generosity\u2019 rather than \u2018magnanimity\u2019, a term used in the Schools, where this virtue is not well known).", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Veneration Veneration or respect is an inclination of the soul not only to have esteem for the object that it reveres but also to submit to it with some fear in order to try to gain its favour.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Scorn At the same time, what I call \u2018scorn\u2019 is our soul\u2019s inclination to despise a free cause in judging it so far beneath us that, although by nature capable of doing good or evil, it is incapable of doing either to us.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For the more noble and generous our soul is, the more we are inclined to render to each person that which belongs to him; thus, not only do we have a very deep humility before God, but also we are not reluctant to render to each 456 person all the honour and respect due to him according to his position and authority in the world, and we have contempt solely for vices.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Hope and anxiety Hope is a disposition of the soul to be convinced that what it desires will come about.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And anxiety is another disposition of the soul, which convinces it that its desires will not be fulfilled.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Keeping the soul balanced, as it were, between several actions open to it, irresolution causes it not to perform any of them, and thus gives it time to make a choice before committing itself.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Courage and boldness Courage, when a passion and not a habit or natural inclination, is a certain heat or agitation which disposes the soul to apply itself energeti- cally to accomplish the tasks it wants to perform, whatever their nature may be.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And boldness is a kind of courage which disposes the soul to carry out the most dangerous tasks.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"The latter is nothing but a heat which disposes the soul to undertake tasks in which it hopes to be able to succeed because it sees others succeed in them.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It is a listlessness or coldness which prevents the soul from bringing itself to carry out the tasks which it would perform if it were free from this passion.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"And fear or terror, which is opposed to boldness, is not only a coldness, but also a disturbance and astonishment of the soul which deprives it of the power to resist the evils which it thinks lie close at hand.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Besides freeing the soul from such efforts, it is also useful for the body in that it slows the movement of the spirits and thereby prevents us from wasting our energy.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It bears witness to the cheerfulness of his temper and the tranquillity of his soul, which are signs 466 of virtue; and it often shows the quickness of his mind, in his ability to put a pleasant gloss on the objects of his mockery.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For as regards the advantages we possess from birth \u2014 those of the soul or even of the body \u2014 the fact that we received them from God before we were capable of doing any evil suffices to make us worthy of them.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"But the sadness of this pity is not bitter: like that caused by the tragic actions we see represented on the stage, it is more external, affecting the senses more than the interior of the soul, which yet has the satisfaction of thinking that it is doing its duty in feeling compassion for those afflicted.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Self-satisfaction The satisfaction of those who steadfastly pursue virtue is a habit of their soul which is called \u2018tranquillity\u2019 and \u2018peace of mind\u2019.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"This is why it has much more strength, especially in the souls of those who are to any degree noble and generous.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"It is weak and abject souls who most allow themselves to be carried away by the second sort of anger The other kind of anger, in which hatred and sadness predominate, is not so apparent at first except perhaps in so far as it makes the face grow pale.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"As it is the most generous souls who have the most gratitude, so it is those with the most vanity, the most abject and weak, who let themselves most readily be 481 carried away by this kind of anger.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"For the wrongs that arouse our anger appear greater in proportion as vanity increases our self-esteem and also in proportion to our esteem for the good things which they take away; and the weaker and more abject our soul, the greater our esteem for these good things, since they depend on others.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"Moreover, the objects of the passions produce movements in the blood which follow so rapidly from the mere impres- sions formed in the brain and the disposition of the organs, without any help at all from the soul, that no amount of human wisdom is capable of counteracting these movements when we are not adequately prepared to do so.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
{"text":"When we feel our blood agitated in this way, we should take heed, and recollect that everything presented to the imagination tends to mislead the soul and make the reasons for pursuing the object of its passion appear much stronger than they are, and the reasons for not pursuing this object much weaker.", "meta":{"source":"Descartes, Passions"}}
