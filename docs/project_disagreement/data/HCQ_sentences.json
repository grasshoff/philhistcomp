meta-analysis.","88":"The results of the meta-analysis on comparative studies indicated no significant clinical effectiveness (negative in RT-PCR evaluation) for HCQ regimen in the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to control group (RR: 1.03, 95% CI, 0.79-1.34).","89":"The same result was observed for the combination of HCQ+azithromycin (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74).","90":"No significant

Background","116":"There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","117":"Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ).","118":"Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19.","119":"Methods","120":"We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in

(450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g).","122":"In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.","123":"This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527 .","124":"Findings","125":"Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled.","126":"The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage.","127":"Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%).","128":"In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient.","129":"Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards.","130":"Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm.","131":"Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","132":"The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern.","133":"Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19.","134":"Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals.","135":"COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome.","136":"Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset","137":"Still's

appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease.","140":"Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","141":"Antiviral drugs like lopinavir\/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored.","142":"Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens.","143":"Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used.","144":"Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices.","145":"Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.","146":"Key Points\u2022 Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\u2022","147":"Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.\u2022","148":"Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.","149":"Use of these drugs is premature and potentially harmful","150":"OBJECTIVE:","151":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns.","152":"The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19.","153":"Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.","154":"In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria.","155":"In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used.","156":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action.","157":"The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations.","158":"We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.","159":"MATERIALS AND METHODS:","160":"We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.","161":"The studies on  COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries.","162":"The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus.","163":"In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries.","164":"The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020.","165":"RESULTS","166":": For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports.","167":"These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections.","168":"We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic.","169":"CONCLUSIONS:","170":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro.","171":"The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.","172":"People are currently using these drugs for malaria.","173":"It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","174":"Chloroquine \u2014 an approved malaria drug \u2014 is known in nanomedicine research for the investigation of nanoparticle uptake in cells, and may have potential for the treatment of COVID-19.","175":"Aims: Studies have indicated that chloroquine (CQ) shows antagonism against COVID-19 in vitro.","176":"However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited.","177":"This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","178":"Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.","179":"All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg\/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ.","180":"Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years.","181":"No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group.","182":"But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group.","183":"Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 32) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 32).","184":"Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group.","185":"However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group.","186":"Significance:","187":"Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","188":"BACKGROUND:","189":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.","190":"We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.","191":"PATIENTS AND METHODS:","192":"French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting.","193":"Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.","194":"Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls.","195":"Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.","196":"RESULTS:","197":"Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms.","198":"Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients.","199":"Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine","200":"was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.","201":"CONCLUSION:","202":"Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction\/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","203":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China.","204":"Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China.","205":"The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.","206":"The current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective therapies.","207":"Anti-malarial medicine","208":"chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","209":"However, there are public concerns and disputes about both the safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new application.","210":"Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.","211":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918.","212":"We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19.","213":"Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommendations.","214":"At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence.","215":"Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020."}}
