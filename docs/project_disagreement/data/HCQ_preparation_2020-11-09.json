The infection, transmitted by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims. Person-to-person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact. The median incubation period is 5\u2009days. The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities.In children COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18\u2009years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29\u2009years of age. For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection. Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients. Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure.Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID-19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well as offering their experience in the possible alternative use of immunomodulatory drugs.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Springer Nature","aff_city_name":["Florence","Siena","Milan","Turin"],"aff_country_name":["Italy"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12969-020-00422-z","pub_date":"2020-12","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":15,"altmetric_id":80384339,"altmetric":14,"authors_full":["Francesco Licciardi","Teresa Giani","Letizia Baldini","Ennio Giulio Favalli","Roberto Caporali","Rolando Cimaz"]},"1":{"title":"Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2","aff_org_name":["University of Minnesota","Duke University","Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital; Harvard Medical School, Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Boston, MA, USA","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.01322143060.24","ur.01361554135.48","ur.01246723061.07","ur.01025716763.05","ur.0731146262.13","ur.01153330670.34","ur.011033374667.88","ur.012320200314.42","ur.0731066053.82","ur.013755045212.55","ur.01045103044.18"],"researcher_dim_count":11,"journal_title":"Critical Care","language":"en","abstract":"","open_access":true,"publisher":"Springer Nature","aff_city_name":["Minneapolis","Durham","Chapel Hill","Boston"],"aff_country_name":["United States"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13054-020-02894-7","pub_date":"2020-12","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":2,"altmetric_id":80779790,"altmetric":17,"authors_full":["Nicholas E.

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.\nMETHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).\nFINDINGS: 96\u2008032 patients (mean age 53\u00b78 years, 46\u00b73% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14\u2008888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81\u2008144 patients were in the control group. 10\u2008698 (11\u00b71%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9\u00b73%), hydroxychloroquine (18\u00b70%; hazard ratio 1\u00b7335, 95% CI 1\u00b7223-1\u00b7457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23\u00b78%; 1\u00b7447, 1\u00b7368-1\u00b7531), chloroquine (16\u00b74%; 1\u00b7365, 1\u00b7218-1\u00b7531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22\u00b72%; 1\u00b7368, 1\u00b7273-1\u00b7469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0\u00b73%), hydroxychloroquine (6\u00b71%; 2\u00b7369, 1\u00b7935-2\u00b7900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8\u00b71%; 5\u00b7106, 4\u00b7106-5\u00b7983), chloroquine (4\u00b73%; 3\u00b7561, 2\u00b7760-4\u00b7596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6\u00b75%; 4\u00b7011, 3\u00b7344-4\u00b7812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.\nINTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.\nFUNDING: William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Elsevier","aff_city_name":["Boston","Chicago","Salt Lake City","Zurich","Nashville"],"aff_country_name":["Switzerland","United States"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(20)31180-6","pub_date":"2020-05","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":361,"altmetric_id":82549788,"altmetric":24765,"authors_full":["Mandeep R Mehra","Sapan S Desai","Frank Ruschitzka","Amit N Patel"]},"4":{"title":"Hydroxychloroquine in patients mainly with mild to moderate COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial","aff_org_name":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Department of Infectious Disease, The Sixth People Hospital of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, Henan, China;","Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hubei Space Hospital of Xiaogan, Xiaogan, Hubei, China;","Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine","Hubei University of Medicine","Departments of Respiratory Medicine, Xiaogan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Xiaogan, Hubei, China;","Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Third People Hospital of Yichang, Yichang, Hubei, China;","Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Yunmeng people's hospital, Xiaogan, Hubei, China;","Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou City, Jingzhou, Hubei, China;","Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiao Gan First People Hospital, Xiaogan, Hubei province, China;","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","Department of Infectious Disease, Wuhan No.7 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China;","Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiaogan hospital affiliated to Wuhan university of science and technology, Xiaogan, Hubei, China;","Department of Infectious Diseases, Central Hospital of Ezhou, Ezhou, Hubei, China;","Department of Respiratory Medicine.

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone. Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild\/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone. Results Among 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days (\u00b1standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 (\u00b110.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

Among all therapeutic approaches, arguments have raised about hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis overcome the controversies regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar and medRxiv pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine up to July 19, 2020. Studies focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with\/without azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients were entered into the study. Two researchers have independently evaluated quality assessment of the studies and abstracted data for data extraction. Extracted data were analyzed using CMA v. 2.2.064. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared (I2) test, and fixed\/random-effects model was used when appropriate for pooling of studies. Results: Out of 26 studies entered into our systematic review, 21 studies including 14 comparative studies with control group and seven observational studies containing 103,486 participants have entered into the meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis on comparative studies indicated no significant clinical effectiveness (negative in RT-PCR evaluation) for HCQ regimen in the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to control group (RR: 1.03, 95% CI, 0.79-1.34). The same result was observed for the combination of HCQ+azithromycin (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74). No significant differences were found for both HCQ (RR: 0.92, 95% CI, 0.72-1.16) and HCQ+AZM (RR: 1.72, 95% CI, 0.86-3.42) mortality rate; however, mortality was affected by age differences according to meta-regression analysis (P&lt;0.000001). No substantial difference was observed for disease exacerbation (RR: 1.23, 95% CI, 0.65-2.30) between HCQ group and controls. Also, radiological findings significantly improved in the HCQ group (OR: 0.32, 95% CI, 0.11-0.98). Odds of known HCQ adverse effects (diarrhea, vomiting, blurred vision, rash, headache, etc.) occurred in the HCQ regimen group was approximately 3.5 times of control group (OR: 3.40, 95% CI, 1.65-6.98), but no substantial differences were found regarding intubation odds between HCQ group and control group (OR: 2.11, 95% CI, 0.31-14.03). Meta-analysis indicated no significant prophylactic effects for HCQ (OR: 0.40, 95% CI, 0.04-3.65) Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed no clinical benefits regarding HCQ treatment with\/without azithromycin for COVID-19 patients. Although mortality rate was not significantly different between cases and controls, frequency of adverse effects was substantially higher in HCQ regimen group. However, due to that most of the studies were non-randomized and results were not homogenous, selection bias was unavoidable and further large randomized clinical trials following comprehensive meta-analysis should be taken into account in order to achieve more reliable findings. Also, it is worth mentioning that if this work does not allow to quantify a &quot;value&quot; of the HCQ, it allows at least to know what is not the HCQ and that it would be prudent not to continue investing in this direction.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","aff_city_name":["Tehran","Paris","Mashhad","Arlington","Brno","Sari","Singapore","K\u0101sh\u0101n"],"aff_country_name":["Iran","United States","Czechia","France","Singapore"],"doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065276","pub_date":"2020-04-20","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":16,"altmetric_id":80167806,"altmetric":349,"authors_full":["Amir Shamshirian","Amirhossein Hessami","Keyvan Heydari","Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","Mohammad Ali Ebrahimzadeh","W YIP George","Roya Ghasemian","Meghdad Sedaghat","Hananeh Baradaran","Soheil Mohammadi Yazdi","Elham Aboufazeli","Hamed Jafarpour","Ehsan Dadgostar","Behnaz Tirandazi","Keyvan Karimifar","Aida Eftekhari","Danial Shamshirian"]},"8":{"title":"No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial","aff_org_name":["Inserm","Foch Hospital;","Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien","APHP;"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.01075724207.30","ur.01370253265.34","ur.013462153043.93","ur.01077063633.56","ur.0623266424.91","ur.0626022376.22","ur.01070234167.16","ur.015357512241.59","ur.0767707501.82","ur.01162063463.40","ur.012666667002.55","ur.01222526046.07","ur.01047550034.70","ur.0751431354.49","ur.01315315752.96","ur.01025255237.35","ur.01272716266.44"],"researcher_dim_count":17,"journal_title":"medRxiv","language":"en","abstract":"Background Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527 . Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc&gt;500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.

Environmental factors such as\u00a0air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as\u00a0arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still&#x27;s disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir\/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points\u2022 Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\u2022 Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.\u2022 Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Springer Nature","aff_city_name":["Lviv","Dudley","Lucknow"],"aff_country_name":["Ukraine","United Kingdom","India"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10067-020-05073-9","pub_date":"2020-07","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":83,"altmetric_id":79473443,"altmetric":127,"authors_full":["Durga Prasanna Misra","Vikas Agarwal","Armen Yuri Gasparyan","Olena Zimba"]},"11":{"title":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19","aff_org_name":["University of Oxford","University of Birmingham"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.0634553511.47","ur.0673240307.49"],"researcher_dim_count":2,"journal_title":"The BMJ","language":"NaN","abstract":"Use of these drugs is premature and potentially harmful","open_access":true,"publisher":"BMJ","aff_city_name":["Oxford","Birmingham"],"aff_country_name":["United Kingdom"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.m1432","pub_date":"2020-04-08","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":114,"altmetric_id":79329269,"altmetric":1512,"authors_full":["Robin E Ferner","Jeffrey K Aronson"]},"12":{"title":"Efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19.","aff_org_name":["King Saud University"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.01261121624.12","ur.0720770227.10"],"researcher_dim_count":2,"journal_title":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","language":"en","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns. The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on &quot;COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020.\nRESULTS: For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","open_access":false,"publisher":"NaN","aff_city_name":["Riyadh"],"aff_country_name":["Saudi Arabia"],"doi":"10.26355\/eurrev_202004_21038","pub_date":"2020-04","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":32,"altmetric_id":81638196,"altmetric":807,"authors_full":["S A Meo","D C Klonoff","J Akram"]},"13":{"title":"Insights from nanomedicine into chloroquine efficacy against COVID-19","aff_org_name":["Houston Methodist","University of Maryland, Baltimore","Tulane University","Mayo Clinic"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.0742717770.19","ur.011200452227.34","ur.01136150745.70"],"researcher_dim_count":3,"journal_title":"Nature Nanotechnology","language":"NaN","abstract":"Chloroquine \u2014 an approved malaria drug \u2014 is known in nanomedicine research for the investigation of nanoparticle uptake in cells, and may have potential for the treatment of COVID-19.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Springer Nature","aff_city_name":["Jacksonville","Baltimore","New Orleans","Houston"],"aff_country_name":["United States"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41565-020-0674-9","pub_date":"2020-04","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":85,"altmetric_id":78100533,"altmetric":1156,"authors_full":["Tony Y.

However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg\/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 32) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 32). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","aff_city_name":["Wuhan"],"aff_country_name":["China"],"doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040758","pub_date":"2020-03-30","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":336,"altmetric_id":78616790,"altmetric":7239,"authors_full":["Zhaowei Chen","Jijia Hu","Zongwei Zhang","Shan Jiang","Shoumeng Han","Dandan Yan","Ruhong Zhuang","Ben Hu","Zhan Zhang"]},"15":{"title":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial","aff_org_name":["Thai Binh University of Medicine and Pharmacy","H\u00f4pital l'Archet","H\u00f4pital de la Timone","Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur","IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.","Aix-Marseille University","IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.","Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice","IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France; Thai Binh University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Thai Binh, Viet Nam.","IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France; Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.

We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.\nRESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.\nCONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction\/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","open_access":true,"publisher":"Elsevier","aff_city_name":["Marseille","Nice","Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh"],"aff_country_name":["Vietnam","France"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949","pub_date":"2020-07","pub_year":2020,"times_cited":1809,"altmetric_id":77952531,"altmetric":11989,"authors_full":["Philippe Gautret","Jean-Christophe Lagier","Philippe Parola","Van Thuan Hoang","Line Meddeb","Morgane Mailhe","Barbara Doudier","Johan Courjon","Val\u00e9rie Giordanengo","Vera Esteves Vieira","Herv\u00e9 Tissot Dupont","St\u00e9phane Honor\u00e9","Philippe Colson","Eric Chabri\u00e8re","Bernard La Scola","Jean-Marc Rolain","Philippe Brouqui","Didier Raoult"]},"16":{"title":"Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies","aff_org_name":["Qingdao University","Qingdao Municipal Hospital"],"researcher_dim_id":["ur.010450300621.27","ur.013436202621.43"],"researcher_dim_count":2,"journal_title":"BioScience Trends","language":"en","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China.
