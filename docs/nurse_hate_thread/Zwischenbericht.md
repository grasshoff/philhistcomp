# **Nurse hate threads - "She's not a hero"**

### Background

Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic nurses (alongside doctors and other medical workers) have been celebrated globally for risking their health and working overtime in order to fight the virus. The work done by nurses has been subject to increased attention, which has led to a debate on their work conditions, wages, and the social recognition of their profession. 

The mainstream celebration of nurses has, however, also provoked hatred and frustration in sub-discourses. On the male dominated online imageboard [4chan](4chan.org) there has been a rise of discussion threads revolving around hatred against nurses. These threads mostly appear on the board /pol/ ("Politically Incorrect"). Such threads are often referred to as "nurse hate threads". The vast majority of these discussions combine the hatred against nurses with explicit misogyny; the nurses are mostly incapable, immoral or immature in virtue of being women. Importantly, these characterizations of nurses mostly aim at creating an antithesis to the figure of the hero. Nurses (predominantly in virtue of being women) are ridiculed as not skilled, moral, mature, or smart enough to be real heroes. Rather, they are assumed to exploit the current attention in order to stage themselves as heroes. Thus, they are not only framed as not having the properties of a hero. They are framed as the explicit opposite of a hero; a non-hero. 

### **Project motivation**

The observations sketched above give rise to multiple questions. Why is the figure of a female hero so negatively received in certain online sub-discourses? Are such misogynist attitudes augmented in the context of a pandemic? The covid-19 virus is a  source of global fear and instability. Thus, there is reason to believe that the hatred against female nurses is partly nurtured by a notion of powerlessness and a fear of transforming power relations. There is indeed a connection between the caring provided by nurses and the notion of power. If somebody has the skills to improve or save your life it may give rise to a strong feeling of dependence.[^1] In the current situation the world's societies are absolutely dependent on medical workers, both for health and financial reasons. In other words, the pandemic has emphasized the necessity of nurses and the fact that their profession is crucial in a time of crisis.  

There is an obvious conflict between nurses framed as crucial, courageous and powerful professionals and the more stereotypical image of nurses. Female nurses have always been subject to stereotyping and prejudice, especially in cinema and pornography. They have, amongst other, been framed as less intelligent and as sex symbols.[^2] Are the strong reactions in sub-discourses a consequence of a stereotype threatened by more powerful and heroic narratives? In order to answer all of these questions we need to analyze how the female nurse is portrayed in such sub-discourses. In that sense, this project is only the beginning of a much larger endeavor. It aims at exploring which attributes are used to describe female nurses on 4chan and how such attributes contribute to a negative construction of female nurses as non-heroes. Hopefully the result of this analysis can be utilized in future projects that examine the relation between misogynist nurse hatred and power relations. 

### **Research question**

This project investigates how female nurses are described in online debate on the board /pol/ on 4chan. More concretely, I look closer at how nurses are negatively defined within this discourse as non-heroes. 

### **Research object**

All threads on /pol/ (4chan) containing the word "nurse", dating from the 25th of January to 8th of June 2020. This amounts to 116 threads including xxxxx comments. 

### **Empirical source: 4plebs** 

The threads on 4chan are ephemeral as they are constantly deleted from the website. To access posts dating back to January 2020 I have retrieved data from an archive of 4chan posts, [4plebs](archive.4plebs.org). This unofficial archive uses the software [Asagi](http://eksopl.github.io/asagi/) to save all the posts of selected 4chan boards. 4plebs uses Asagi to dump and archive all threads from selected 4chan boards, including /pol/. No threads are removed unless they are reported to contain child pornography, personally identifiable information, or copyrighted material not permitted under fair use doctrine. [^3]

### **Method**

Underneath is a description of the process. The number and title of each step correspond with the notebook. 

#### 1. Preparing data:

A script was written to scrape the text from all posts on the board /pol/ containing the word "nurse" (dating from 01.25.2020 to 06.08. 2020). This amounts to 116 posts with a total of more than xxxxxx comments. I imported this scrape result and created a dataframe (named "df") using pandas . Given the quantity of the dataset I have chosen to only show the three first comments (with post titles) in the notebook. Moreover, the dataset contained unnecessary information and needed to be cleaned. Redundant letters and post numbers were removed for the purpose of clarity. The column to be used is thus named "clean". 

#### **2. Preparing NLP**: 

Subsequently began the process of preparing the process of natural language processing (NLP).
