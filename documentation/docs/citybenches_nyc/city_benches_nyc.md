## Title: Shortest distance between city benches in NYC


## Background

An important indicator for the senior friendliness of a city is the number and distribution of benches. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the methods of modern data science can be helpful in evaluating the senior friendliness of a city. To achieve this aim, we will calculate the shortest distance between two benches in Manhattan, New York City. Alongside our analysis, we will tackle philosophical questions that are closely related to the scientific methods we apply: 
What is the difference between data wrangling and data corruption? How reliable are the conclusions that we draw from the data with the help of our models?

Using a simple data science project as an example, our investigation shows that philosophical considerations accompany every step of such a project: From the selection of the data, to the preparation of the data set, to the processing of the data and finally to the evaluation of the results of our data analysis. In other words, our investigation indicates that philosophical reasoning is highly relevant in times of big data and automation.
